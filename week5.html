<h2>1. Where are we?</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-77eceb60-9055-978e-3ad9-cafd42d19053">Evaluating your teaching practice is an important part of reflective practice and understanding your current situation and then the effects of your chosen emerging practice. However, there are numerous approaches to evaluating teaching practice and specific contexts might require specific approaches. For example, if you are in a law school, their expectations of teaching evaluations might differ to those of a nursing school; overarching this might be expectations of the higher education institution as well. Therefore, evaluating teaching is not a simple endeavour, but rather it is one that requires thought and consideration of appropriateness of the evaluation process, aims, tools, and analysis methods.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The driving question for this week’s learning path is:</p>
<blockquote>How might I evaluate my teaching practice?</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">The focus for this week and next week is on evaluating your teaching practice, while also considering the evaluation of student learning because it is part of evaluating teaching practice. Through these two weeks, you’ll be able to start working on a personalised evaluation framework that you can use in <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65155#b">Assignment 1, Part B</a>. In these two weeks, you will encounter different approaches to evaluating learning and teaching, but it is important to keep your context in mind when assessing these approaches for suitability and flexibility for your context. <!-- The evaluation presented in these two weeks complements the evaluation of emerging practice that you will consider in the content in Week 8.--></p>

<h2>1. Examining evaluation practices</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-905c-03c4-fdae-b625a7f26c9f">It is difficult to find examples (good or bad) of evaluation of teaching and learning in higher education. It is relatively easy to find examples of how to evaluate teaching and learning, but not the actual evaluations. Academics can be a funny bunch and a bit secretive about their evaluation results, as you might well know and understand. Thus, this book will look at a two examples of evaluation in real life that are not traditional: one example outside of higher education and one example that questions the student evaluation of teaching (SET) in higher education.</p>

<h2>2. Outside higher education</h2>

<p>There are opportunities to evaluate products, services, and much more in everyday life. Consider the amount of review  and recommendation websites that exist now: <a href="http://www.productreview.com.au">ProductReview.com.au</a>, <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com">TripAdvisor</a>, Google reviews, and Facebook reviews. These are all forms of evaluation.</p>

<h2>3. Inside higher education</h2>

<p>Back in early 2014, I (David) attempted to evaluate what had happened in one of the courses I taught as a basis for thinking about what to change in the coming year. As part of this process, I wrote two blog posts:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://djon.es/blog/2014/01/13/evaluating-edc3100-in-2013-step-1/">Evaluating EDC3100 in 2013 - Step 1</a>; and,<br>A post that provides some background and <a href="http://djon.es/blog/2014/01/13/evaluating-edc3100-in-2013-step-1/#bias">my biases</a> (including a summary of student evaluation responses), before <a href="http://djon.es/blog/2014/01/13/evaluating-edc3100-in-2013-step-1/#evaluation">examining student evaluation results</a> for the course and making some early plans for 2014.</li>
<li><a href="http://djon.es/blog/2014/01/15/analysing-some-course-evaluation-comments/">Analysing some course evaluation comments</a>.<br>A post that starts by reflecting more on the quantitative student evaluation results and then presents the results of some open coding of free text responses from students and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/11955601644/in/album-72157629278697801/">visualising the result</a>s</li>
</ol>

<div class="dj_task_title">

<p>Examining the EDC3100 2013 evaluation</p>
</div>


<div class="dj_activity">

<p>Keep the questions shown below in mind as you look at the above two posts from above, but in particular the three images included in those posts.  The three images (be sure to read the description of each image) included were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Comparative means for <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/11863092365/">Semester 1, 2013 online students</a>.</li>
<li>Comparative means for <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/11863092345/">Semester 2, 2013 online students</a>.</li>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-90ac-36a8-4886-a7296628f7c2">Having worked through the experiencing and examining sections, you started thinking about the various different approaches and elements of evaluation. The aim now is to help organise your thinking into a more formal and structured conceptualisation of evaluation. To provide you with a firm foundation upon which to plan and implement the valuation of your teaching practice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The field of evaluation is diverse and deep, depending on the lens that you are using to view it. In this course, we concentrate on evaluation for learning and teaching contexts, particularly self-evaluation, peer evaluation, and student evaluation. However, in order to understand these areas, it is important to understand the goal of evaluation and the types of evidence in more detail.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This book aims to help you answer the following questions</p>

<h2>2. What is evaluation?</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-90ae-a0d2-1321-4fd0d786cbb4">While it is a commonly used word, ‘evaluation’ should be defined so that we have a mutual understanding of it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Simply put, evaluation is the determination or fixing the value of something, or the determination of the significance, worth, or condition of something usually by careful appraisal or study (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evaluation">Merriam-Webster, 2017</a>). In the context of learning and teaching, evaluation is more complex and includes notions of evidence, data, methods, and processes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These components of evaluation should be clarified for higher education contexts in order to develop a common foundation from which to explore the different types of evaluation that can be undertaken in your learning and teaching context.</p>

<h2>3. What are the goals of evaluation?</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-6ce3403c-90af-b754-aa5e-a369876f826f">Berriet-Solliec, Labarthe, and Laurent (2014) describe three distinct goals of evaluation:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">to measure (designed to assess the effects of a program),</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">to understand (designed to identify and analyse the mechanisms through which the program under evaluation can produce the expected outcomes or create diverse effects), and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">to learn (designed as a collective learning process).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-b4e2e5a4-b659-4776-c264-0bca9dfa9182">These three goals align with the common goals of evaluating teaching practice. That is, when we are evaluating our teaching practice, we are attempting to measure, understand, and/or learn about our teaching and its effects on student learning. The following are three examples of these goals in practice in higher education contexts.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">To measure. <br>A teacher wants to measure the change in student understanding as a result of undertaking their course. They could design a questionnaire to measure student understanding of the content at the beginning, middle, and end of the course. Then, they would compare the results and determine if there are changes in student understanding of the course content. In this way, the evaluation of the student learning (i.e. the three questionnaires) are designed to assess the effects (or effectiveness) of the course.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">To understand. <br>A teacher wants to understand if a specific technological tool can support greater student engagement in their course. So, they design a learning experience that can be undertaken in two ways - one that uses the tool and one that does not use the tool. The teacher then evaluates the level of student engagement in the activity as a way to understand if and how the tool can support this.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">To learn. <br>A teacher wants to learn more about how students perceive their course, so they include course-specific questions (i.e. more than the core questions) in their student evaluation of course and teaching experience questionnaire that the institution administers at the end of the teaching period.</p>

<h2>4. What types of evaluation are there?</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-90c1-093a-48ab-5add490fb2d0">In higher education, evaluations typically fall into three broad categories: self evaluation, peer evaluation, and student evaluation. Each of these types of evaluation have specific purposes and can be used in your learning and teaching context in order to more fully measure, understand, and learn about your teaching.</p>

<h3>4.1. Self evaluation</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-90c3-b878-10fb-01c0e68a5c03">Self evaluation is as it sounds - evaluating yourself. However, it’s not as easy as it sounds, either. That is, you need to consider a lot more than simple reflection of your teaching practice, such as different ways to understand and observe your teaching practice. Self evaluation can take many forms and involve a range of resources to help inform you. For example, you could refer to the <a href="https://www.aqf.edu.au/">AQF</a> to help evaluate whether your course content and teaching meets the expectations for your AQF level. Your own professional learning goals can also form part of your self evaluation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a quick guide to self evaluation, <a href="http://www.gtcs.org.uk/professional-standards/self-evaluation/self-evaluation.aspx">The General Teaching Council for Scotland</a> provides the following summary of self evaluation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Self-evaluation should be a useful process that is rigorous and enables you to be critically reflective about yourself as a professional and your practice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Self-evaluation should support you to:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Reflect on what you have done</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Think about what you might do next</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Consider your own progress and development</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Deeply understand your professional practice, your professional learning and the impact of this on your thinking, professional actions, those you work with/support and the pupils and their learning</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Self-evaluation will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Asking deep and searching questions about self and practice</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Using the GTCS Standards to inform and guide your reflections</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Using other influencing factors such as school or dept improvement plan; other standards or targets; issues relevant to your particular context</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Using your ongoing reflections and enquiry into practice</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Considering the needs of learners/colleagues in your context</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Using evidence from a range of sources to inform and support your self-evaluation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The self-evaluation process will enable you to:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Plan for meaningful professional learning</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Engage in critically reflective dialogue as part of the PRD process</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Identify and focus on areas you wish to develop expertise or accomplishment</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Consider your career planning</p>

<h3>4.2. Peer evaluation</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-90c5-1a19-555b-152f9a7d9756">Peer evaluation is the process of collegial feedback on the quality of your teaching. It is a purposeful process of gathering information and evidence about the effectiveness of your teaching processes and environments with a view to obtaining constructive feedback. You can approach a peer (colleague, industry professional, educational designer, etc.) to evaluate your teaching. This evaluation can occur in whichever manner you are teaching - it is not limited to an observation of your class. It can include evaluation of your online learning and teaching environment and activities, content, assessment items, student feedback, and so on. The typical purpose of peer evaluation is for either formative (for development) or summative (for personnel decision) purposes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.flinders.edu.au/teaching/quality/evaluation/peer-review/evaluate.cfm">Flinders University</a> provides some clear guidelines on the components of peer evaluation. These are described here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Peers are a useful source of information about the whole learning and teaching cycle from curriculum design and development, through planning and preparation, and learning and teaching interactions, to critical review to improve and enhance teaching.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Peers are able to comment on:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">philosophy and approach to teaching</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">presentation skills</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">group work and facilitation skills</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">course material and resources</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">assessment methods</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">curriculum development</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">aims, objectives and content</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">identifying opportunities for professional development</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Peers are able to provide feedback on the elements of teaching and the relationships and alignment between them, before, during and after learning and teaching activities. Peer evaluation can be used in the following ways to enhance teaching practice:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">gaining feedback on teaching from a colleague which adds another dimension to feedback collected from students and through self-reflection.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">as a mechanism for collecting evidence to support both promotion and teaching awards applications.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">as an input to discussion and reflection on:</p>
</li>
<ol><ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">teaching strategies</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">assignments</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">assessment methods</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">monitoring of student learning</p>
</li>
</ol></ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">class and/or syllabus review</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">addressing problems in a topic</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">discussion and reflection on new ideas on teaching.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Peer evaluation is not:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">‘novice learning from expert&#39; - it should be collegial and directed towards honing skills not cloning skills</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">for training people in a particular way of teaching.</p>

<h3>4.3. Student evaluation</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-b4e2e5a4-b664-5abd-36df-50bfd9091a93">Student feedback and evaluation are rich sources of information about the delivered learning and teaching experiences. This information can be used formatively and summatively, and it is often used as evidence for staff promotion, probation and awards, and for internal and external quality assurance reporting requirements. Student evaluations are regularly sought at the institutional level through student evaluations of teaching (also known as course experience surveys, student evaluation of course and teaching, student feedback, etc.). At USQ, the institutional level student feedback survey is called <a href="https://www.usq.edu.au/sbmi/strategic-information/survey/student-course-evaluation">MyOpinion</a> and it is a set of core questions with the teacher having the option to add an additional customised questions from the approved question bank.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Student evaluations and feedback are used to ensure a student-centred approach whereby students are engaged and the student feedback informs course development and quality enhancement of courses. Student feedback also has the potential to provide valuable insights to the teacher through providing understanding of how the learning has been experienced. This feedback can augment self and peer evaluations to provide a richer and deeper evaluation of a learning episode, environment, event, and so on.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As Macquarie University’s <a href="https://staff.mq.edu.au/teaching/evaluation/evaluation_methods/student_feedback/">Teaching Evaluation site</a> states, student evaluation is important for:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">ensuring that students enjoy high quality learning experience,</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">your continual improvement as a teacher,</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">the continual improvement of the course and program of study that is being offered, and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">ensuring that the University is achieving the desired standard of quality in students&#39; learning experiences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 dir="ltr">Types of student evaluation sources of evidence</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.education.gov.au/australian-awards-university-teaching">Australian Awards for University Teaching (AAUT)</a> divide student evaluation sources of evidence into two types: student reactions and student learning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Student reactions focus on what students tell you about your teaching and their learning. The types of evidence can include</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">student evaluations of teaching,</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">student interviews and focus groups,</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">informal class feedback,</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">formal surveys and questionnaires,</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">unsolicited student feedback,</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">student logs and journals, and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">online feedback.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Student learning focuses on the indicators of student learning that attest to the success of your teaching strategies. The types of evidence can include</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">students’ self-reported knowledge/skills gained,</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">rates of attrition, failure, progression to honours/postgraduate,</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">grade distribution,</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">evaluation of generic skills/outcomes/attributes,</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">student work - assessment, theses, projects,</p>

<div class="dj_activity">Time to apply ideas about the types of evaluation, to the teaching episode you started pondering in <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=809187&amp;chapterid=66360">this earlier activity</a>. <br class="dj_activity">

<p></p>

<p>Using that same teaching episode, use the <em>Components of Evaluation </em>Word document to write a response to the following question.</p>
<blockquote>What type of evaluation could support your chosen teaching episode/emerging practice? <em>Remember that you can choose more than one type, or more than one method within a type.</em></blockquote>

<p>If you find that you’d rather change the object of your evaluation, then feel free to do so, but you’ll need to modify the first two questions first.</p>

<hr>

<div class="book_chapter"><a name="ch66365"></a>
<h2>5. What is &quot;evidence&quot;?</h2>

<p>Evidence is the myriad of “things” that constitute information or demonstrate the object of the evaluation. These “things” can be quantitative or qualitative in nature.</p>

<p>For example, if the effectiveness of a traditional lecture is the goal of evaluation, then the evidence could include number of students attending, the presentation materials, a recording of the lecture, the number of questions asked during the lecture, the responses to set tasks (e.g. in the lecture, the teacher directs students to a forum - do they participate in the forum?), and so on.</p>

<p>Because there are so many types of evidence that can be collected, it is important to understand the goal of the evaluation in order to determine which types of evidence will best support the evaluation.</p>

<p>The following table (adapted from the <a href="https://docs.education.gov.au/node/41101">&quot;Evidence checklist for teaching awards&quot;</a>, provides some idea of the different types of sources of evidence.</p>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">evidence of presence;<br>Evidence that demonstrates that a phenomenon or object exists and is present, the most straightforward type of evidence.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">evidence of difference-making; and<br>Sometimes known as evidence of effectiveness, refers to evidence that demonstrates impact (or lack thereof) of a phenomenon.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">evidence of a mechanism for a phenomenon.<br>Refers to the evidence that confirms a relationship or phenomenon, e.g. confirming that a specific tool does increase student engagement.</p>

<h3>5.2. What about data?</h3>

<p>Data is a type of evidence, and one that can be more easily processed. For example, if the effectiveness of traditional lectures is the goal of the evaluation, the number of students attending the lecture is a type of data that can be collected and easily processed in terms of increased/decreased attendance over a period of time. Note that the number of students attending is also evidence, so there can be an overlap between data and evidence. Data can be classified as qualitative or quantitative in nature, and it can come in a variety of forms from a variety of sources, as some were identified in section 1.2. </p>

<p>For some tertiary educators quantitative and qualitative data will be old friends. If you&#39;re uncertain about the differences between qualitative and quantitative data then resources such <a href="http://keydifferences.com/difference-between-qualitative-and-quantitative-data.html#ixzz4g4OsLo9e">as this page</a> (the comparison chart might be a good place to start) as might YouTube videos (e.g. <a class="nomediaplugin" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcKrT_IegoU">this one</a>)</p>

<h2>6. What are methods and processes</h2>

<p><link href="https://djon.es/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"></p>

<p>
<script src="https://djon.es/edu8702_macro.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</p>

<p>Methods refers to the way in which you choose to evaluate your learning and teaching. There are a number of different options for approaching the evaluation of teaching and learning, and they primarily depend on the type of question or evaluation that you are undertaking. The evaluation methods are useful for understanding how you will collect data, analyse data, report data, and make decisions about the evaluation.<br><br>There are structured ways in which you can use the methods to undertake evaluations; they are sometimes also referred to as approaches. While there are some common processes that can be followed like a recipe, you can also define your own process that will better suit your context. In many cases, it can be good to start with a common process and then adapt it to your specific context considering your question, data, and so on.</p>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-bf93-1a50-f7d2-ca7715ab7af2">There are various methods that you can use to collect evaluative data. In general, you can collect data from individuals and groups, and through observations, physical measurements, and reviewing existing records and data. Some options for collecting data in these ways can be found on <a href="http://www.betterevaluation.org/en/plan/describe/collect_retrieve_data">BetterEvaluation.org</a>, but keep in mind that some of these methods might not be appropriate to learning and teaching contexts. There is also a data collection matrix presented in Table 11.1 in <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=F8BFOM8DCKoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA297&amp;dq=data+collection+methods+educational+research&amp;ots=gVaNtDmsOf&amp;sig=4JlapC3B4qon2ZHvQpyFNzVvYPY#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Johnson &amp; Turner’s (2003) chapter</a> in the Handbook of Mixed Methods in SOcial &amp; Behavioral Research; it could be worthwhile reading pages 297-299 if this chapter for a deeper explanation of how different data collection methods can align with qualitative and quantitative methods, or how they can be mixed. Combining the content in the two previous links with that provided in the <a href="http://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/lt/resources/handouts/SelfEvaluation.pdf">Ryerson resource on self-evaluation</a>, you can begin to see how different data collection methods can be used to obtain data and evidence for your evaluation. In particular, have a look at how Ryerson have presented different self-evaluation methods with different data collection methods - you could consider using some of these in your evaluation.</p>

<h2>7. What are the criticisms and challenges of evaluation?</h2>

<p><link href="https://djon.es/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"></p>

<script src="https://djon.es/edu8702_macro.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</p>

<p> By now, you should have an understanding of the components that make up an evaluation and the complex interplay between these components. When designed well with appropriate selection of tools (e.g. the evidence aligns with the question asked, which aligns with the purpose of the evaluation, etc.), evaluation can provide critical insight into a specific area under investigation and illuminate areas of competence and need.</p>

<p>However, it is important to be able to interpret the data and evidence gathered in context, rather than just as numbers or discrete artefacts. In an attempt to better understand this interpretation, please read <a href="http://ezproxy.usq.edu.au/login?url=https://doi.org/10.1002/tl.10001" style="text-decoration: none;">this article</a> by Franklin (2001).  As you read this article, reflect on the following questions (perhaps write a blog post):</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Considering your answers to the questions in the previous activities in this book, what are three critical contextual factors that need to be understood in order to interpret your proposed evaluation?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What are two concerns that you must address regarding the validity and reliability of your evidence/data?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What would be an acceptable response rate for your context, if you are using student data/student responses?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What are the potential pitfalls of your broad conceptualisation of the evaluation? How could you potentially mitigate these?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Are there any other considerations that you should make in order to make your evaluation more robust and useful?</p>

<h2>1. Where are you?</h2>

<p>Throughout this week, you have been learning about the components of evaluation in general and more specifically for learning and teaching evaluation. Now, it&#39;s time to think back to <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65155#b">Assignment 1, Part B</a>, and see how this information on evaluation can be adapted to your chosen teaching episode.</p>

<p>To refresh your memory, <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65155#b">Part B</a> from Assignment 1 asks you to think of a learning and teaching episode from your recent past, and design an evaluation plan for that episode. At this point, you should have a clearer understanding about evaluation, what it is, how it can be done, evidence, types of evidence, data, and data collection. So, it is time to apply it to your context.</p>

<h2>2. Which episode?</h2>


<div class="dj_task" id="connect">
<p dir="ltr">At the <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=809187&amp;chapterid=66360">beginning of the Explain book</a>, you were asked to think about a teaching episode from your past that you could use for Assignment 1, Part B. It’s time to work with that episode and begin to consider your evaluation of it. If you have more than one episode to choose from, then you can use this process to eliminate the episodes that have less opportunity for thorough evaluation.</p>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-c01a-b253-c070-aa795342f6c0">To start with, consider your teaching episode(s) and answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What was the focus of the teaching episode?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">When/where did it occur?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">How many students were involved? What were the demographics of the students?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What is the key “thing” about the teaching episode that you want to evaluate?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Are there any other aspects of the teaching episode that are relevant?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">If you have more than one teaching episode to choose from, do this for all teaching episodes so that the next step can help you narrow your choice of episode.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now that you have a description of your teaching episode(s), it is time to see what you can evaluate, whether it will work for you, and how you might begin to think about the evaluation. Do not worry about the detailed evaluation process yet - that is part of next week’s activities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For each of your teaching episodes, create a new document with the components of evaluation filled in. Note that the first question in the goals of evaluation should align with your response to the question above on “What is the key “thing” about the teaching episode that you want to evaluate?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you can’t fill in the content, then take more time to think about what you are trying to achieve through the evaluation and what will support you to achieve it. This could also help you in the process of deciding which teaching episode to focus on - it can support your evaluation of the teaching episodes for the one that will best fulfil the requirements of the assignment. Once you have completed the table, you will have a stronger idea about how you might approach the evaluation of the teaching episode, and you can use this next week develop a full evaluation plan for the teaching episode.</p>
