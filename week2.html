<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>This week&#39;s learning path is designed to get you started on your journey into inquiring into learning and teaching in your context. To do that you&#39;ll be asked to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read about some of the issues that have driven other teachers to inquire into student learning.</li>
<li>Give some initial though to some of the issues around student learning that might drive your inquiry into learning and teaching.</li>
<li>Take a big step back, learn about critical reflection and a process for uncovering assumptions.</li>
<li>Use that process to uncover some of the assumptions embedded in earlier examples.</li>
<li>Learn more abut different types of lenses that can help surface assumptions about learning and teaching.</li>
<li>Bring all of that together and start thinking about the context, issues and assumptions that will underpin your inquiry into learnign and teaching (Assignment 1, Part A).</li>
</ul>

 <!-- ******** Chapter:  2. Revisiting stage 1 - Initiation **********  -->

<div class="book_chapter"><a name="ch65976"></a>
<h2>2. Revisiting stage 1 - Initiation</h2>

<p>Toward the end of last week&#39;s learning path <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=798714">you were introduced</a> to the particular model we&#39;ll be using in this course to guide teaching inquiry into student learning (TISL). The first stage of that process model is <strong>Initiation</strong>. <a href="http://openeducationeuropa.eu/en/article/Towards-Teacher-led-Design-Inquiry-of-Learning?paper=134810">Emin-martinez et al (2014)</a> offer this scenario to describe initiation</p>
<blockquote>A possible scenario for the integrated model follows Carla, a chemistry and mathematics teacher in an Upper secondary school. Her analysis of students’ assessment last year suggested some common misconceptions in the understanding of converging series. This year she decided to inquire this problem more thoroughly. She consults the integrated model to plan her teacher research project. The Initiation was her realization of the students’ misconceptions. (p. 8)</blockquote>

<p> The TISL Heart Model is another model for teacher inquiry into student learning that uses <strong>Kick-off</strong> as the <strong>Initiation</strong> equivalent. Hansen &amp; Wasson (2016) offers this description</p>
<blockquote>TISL Heart begins with the Kick-off, which is when a teacher first identifies the issues related to student learning in which s/he is interested (p. 39)</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;ll start this week by looking at some of the issues that have kicked-off other teacher inquiry into student learning.</p>

</div>

 <!-- ******** Chapter:  3. Example issues for teacher inquiry **********  -->

<hr>

<div class="book_chapter"><a name="ch65977"></a>
<h2>3. Example issues for teacher inquiry</h2>

<p>There are two different examples on the following pages.</p>
<h4>How to increase completion?</h4>

<p><a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803052&amp;chapterid=65978">The first</a> is an example of an issue that&#39;s been thought through and brought into a clear logical argument to motivate a particular approach. </p>

<p>This example is quite a bit more detailed and lengthy than what is expected in the assessment for this course. However, it does illustrate the type of evidence and use of literature that would useful to include in your assessment pieces. It also provides an example of the type of formal academic writing and use of the web environment that we will expect for your assessable blog posts.</p>
<h4>How to replace lectures?</h4>

<p><a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803052&amp;chapterid=65979">The second</a> is a longitudinal (2012 through 2017) collection of examples that culminates in a blog post directly related to this course.</p>

<p>This collection of examples are not formally written. Instead, they are an example of the type of &quot;writing to think&quot; we encourage (and expect) you to use for you non-assessable blog posts.</p>

<p>This collection of examples also shows the evolutionary development of a particular idea that arises from an on-going cycle of teacher inquiry into learning and teaching. They also show how using a blog to record this thinking provides advantages in terms of enabling others to comment on your thoughts, and of having a searchable record of your thinking and its evolution.</p>

<h3>3.1. How to increase completion?</h3>

<p><a href="http://djon.es/blog/publications/enhancing-the-learning-journey-for-distance-education-students-in-an-introductory-programming-course/">This blog post</a> contains a complete paper outlining the rationale and plan for a teacher inquiry into student learning (one that was never implemented). The <a href="http://djon.es/blog/publications/enhancing-the-learning-journey-for-distance-education-students-in-an-introductory-programming-course/#problem">problem section</a> outlines in some detail the problem and links it to the broader disciplinary and distance education literature.</p>

<p>As mentioned on the previous page, this blog post provides an example of the type of formal academic writing expected for the assessable blogs posts for this course. However, the length and specific structure of this blog post does differ from what is expected for the course assessment.</p>

<p></p>

</div>

 <!-- ******** Sub-chapter:  3.2. How to replace lectures? **********  -->

<hr>

<div class="book_chapter"><a name="ch65979"></a>
<h3>3.2. How to replace lectures?</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the following examples illustrate a type of teacher inquiry into student learning that leans more toward thinking out loud and documenting design ruminations, than a full fledged inquiry into student learning. The examples show the evolution over a number of years of the approach to designing and online course that is being used in EDU8702.</p>

<p>The current intent is to continue to use these examples for the rest of the course.</p>
<h4>Origins</h4>

<p><a href="http://djon.es/blog/2012/02/10/how-to-replace-the-lecture/">This blog post</a> from Feburary 2012 explains an issue that I (David) faced in a course I was teaching when I first started at USQ. My issue was that, arguably, lectures suck pedagogically. In addition most of the students in that course wouldn&#39;t have been able to hear the lectures I gave.</p>

<p>So, what to do? It mentions an initial idea - does that idea ring a bell with anything you&#39;ve experienced in this course?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget to read the comments, a useful illustration of the benefits of sharing your thinking in an open space.</p>
<h4>Early evolution</h4>

<p>A week or so later this post - <a href="http://djon.es/blog/2012/02/19/designing-the-weekly-ramble/">Designing the weekly ramble</a> - picks up the thinking. Briefly identifies some of the inspiration, offers a new metaphor (ramble) and offers some thoughts on the design.</p>
<h4>And it&#39;s back to the lecture</h4>

<p>A <a href="http://djon.es/blog/2012/03/06/and-its-back-to-a-lecture/">March 2012 blog post</a> shares (vents?) about a return to giving a lecture.</p>
<h4>Redesigning the ramble and the course</h4>

<p>A <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2012/07/15/redesigning-the-weekly-ramble/">July 2012 blog post</a> (end of the first Semester) reflects on the experience and student evaluation results. Uses that to identify some of what worked and what didn&#39;t. It identifies the next set of issues and makes plans for an evolutionary redesign, starting the inquiry cycle over again.</p>

<p>The first comment on this post is from a student who took the course.</p>

<p><a href="http://djon.es/blog/2012/07/20/starting-the-re-design-of-edc3100/">This post</a> from 5 days later goes into more detail of the issues with the course and starts conceptualising a broader change.</p>
<h4>How much of a cage should I build?</h4>

<p><a href="http://djon.es/blog/2013/03/06/how-much-of-a-cage-should-i-build/">This March 2013 blog post</a> identifies a potential problem with how students are engaging with the learning path and how it&#39;s been linked to assessment. It ponders some possible approaches. Again, the comments include a range of additional perspectives from current students and higher education colleagues.</p>
<h4>How to guide the course model with a pedagogical model?</h4>

<p>And <a href="https://edu8702.wordpress.com/2017/07/08/what-course-and-pedagogical-model-to-use-for-edu8702/">this 2017 blog post</a> relates the issue we faced in the design of this course. How could the limitations of the ramble model as it evolved into 2016 be addressed so that it could be used within this course?</p>

<div class="book_chapter"><a name="ch65996"></a>
<h2>4. Broader issues</h2>

<p>The prior examples were very specific to a particular course context. There are broader issues that have been identified. Issues that are common to a particular discipline, or to higher education in general. The following provides a small sample of these types of problems.</p>


<div class="dj_task">


<div class="dj_task_title">

<p>Does anything resonate?</p>
</div>


<div class="dj_activity">

<p>Not surprisingly the following examples draw heavily from the challenges arising from the contexts and disciplines into which I&#39;ve taught. Each context and discipline is likely to have its own challenges and issues.</p>

<p>As you skim through the following, do any of these issues resonate with your context? Start thinking about your context and the issues you are aware of.</p>

<h3>4.2. Issues for higher education</h3>

<p><a href="http://herdsa.org.au/system/files/HERDSARHE2015v02p27_0.pdf">Goodyear (2015)</a> offers one summary of some of the &quot;drivers of change&quot; that are challenging traditional teaching.</p>

<p>Goodyear (2015) identifies</p>
<blockquote>four sets of forces that are having a powerful effect on contemporary higher education&quot;, including (1) In the shift from elite to mass higher education, students’ needs and expectations are diversifying and the educational and logistical demands being made of universities are becoming harder to meet. (2) Employers and their representatives are continuing to criticise universities for failing to produce work-ready graduates. Students themselves are questioning whether they are getting a fair return on the time and fees they are investing. (3) The technologies being used in knowledge work—for research and teaching and in other areas of intellectual life—are changing rapidly. New knowledge practices are emerging, such as those involving data analytics, visualisation and very complex forms of computational modelling. The pace of technological innovation is accelerating. This creates risk and uncertainty for university managers, especially with respect to campus planning, IT and educational strategies in the longer term. (4) Dwindling public funding of teaching, as well as competing demands on time—for research, service, entrepreneurial activities, etc.—are intensifying the pressures on teaching staff. (p. 36)</blockquote>

 <!-- ******** Chapter:  1. Introduction **********  -->

<hr>

<div class="book_chapter"><a name="ch65998"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Last week&#39;s learning path tried to establish <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=798713&amp;chapterid=65798">how important reflection</a> is to the act of becoming a Master teacher. It also offered <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=798711">some early explanations</a> of how this course has been designed to enable and require reflection.</p>

<p>Reflection is a complex process. There has been a great deal of literature and advice written about what reflection is, how it should be done, how it can be measured, its limitations etc. Some of what&#39;s been written can be incredibly complex to understand.</p>

<p>This book introduces the view of reflection that will underpin this course. These are provided here to help scaffold your engagement with the course, rather than position them as the &quot;perfect&quot; take on reflection. The book  describes</p>
<ul>
<li>different types of reflective writing;<br>(The rubrics for the course assignments use these types)</li>
<li>elements to be expected within reflective writing; and,</li>
<li>a process for engaging in critical reflection.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end you will be asked to apply some of this to the issues that were shared in the first part of this learning path.</p>

</div>

 <!-- ******** Chapter:  2. A developmental framework of reflection **********  -->

<div class="book_chapter"><a name="ch65999"></a>
<h2>2. A developmental framework of reflection</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-21c523fa-24b2-6cdd-1094-a636c04c5659"><a href="http://ezproxy.usq.edu.au/login?url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0742051X9400012U">Hatton &amp; Smith (1995)</a> undertook a process which identified (emphasis added)</p>
<blockquote>four types of writing, three of which were characterised as different kinds of reflection. Defining characteristics for <strong>descriptive writing</strong>, <strong>descriptive reflection</strong>, <strong>dialogic reflection</strong> and <strong>critical reflection</strong>…. In essence, the first is not reflective at all, but merely reports events or literature. The second, <strong>descriptive</strong>, does attempt to provide reasons based often on personal judgement or on students&#39; reading of literature. The third form, <strong>dialogic</strong>, is a form of discourse with one&#39;s self, an exploration of possible reasons. The fourth, <strong>critical</strong>, is defined as involving reason giving for decisions or events which takes account of the broader historical, social, and/or political contexts. (p. 40-41)</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">It is important to note that these types of reflective writing (descriptive, dialogic and critical) should not be seen as a hierarchy or as exclusionary. i.e. you should not always be aiming to avoid descriptive reflection and always produce critical reflection. Hatton and Smith (1995) identify that it is inevitable that some descriptive writing is necessary to describe the context. Hatton and Smith (1995) end up identifying a developmental framework that sees the individual developing the (emphasis added)</p>
<blockquote>capacity to undertake <strong>reflection-in-action</strong>, which is conceived of as the most demanding type of reflecting upon one&#39;s own practice, calling for the ability to apply, singly or in combination, qualitatively distinctive kinds of reflection (namely technical, descriptive, dialogic, or critical) to a given situation as it is unfolding. In other words, the professional practitioner is able consciously to think about an action as it is taking place, making sense of what is happening and shaping successive practical steps using multiple viewpoints as appropriate. (p. 46)</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">For the purpose and confines of this course, the focus is just on being aware of the different types of reflection identified by Hatton and Smith (1995)</p>

<li>Recognition of alternate viewpoints in the research and literature which are reported. For example, Tyler (1949), because of the assumptions on which his approach rest suggests that the curriculum process should begin with objectives. Yinger (1979), on the other hand argues that the &quot;task&quot; is the starting point.</li>
<li>Two forms:<br><ol>
<li>Reflection based generally on one perspective/factor as rationale.</li>
<li>Reflection is based on the recognition of multiple factors and perspectives</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="table_row">
<td>Dialogic reflection</td>
<td>

<p>Demonstrates a &quot;stepping back&quot; from the events/actions leading to a different level of mulling about, discourse with self and exploring the experience, events, and actions using qualities of judgements and possible alternatives for explaining and hypothesising. Such reflection is analytical or/and integrative of factors and perspectives and may recognise inconsistencies in attempting to provide rationales and critique, for example.</p>
<blockquote>While I planned to use mainly written text materials I became aware very quickly that a number of students did not respond to these. Thinking about this now there may have been several reasons for this. A number of students, while reasonably proficient in English, even though they had been NESB learners, may still have lacked some confidence in handling the level of language in the text. Alternatively, a number of students may have been visual and tactile learners. In any case I found that I had to employ more concrete activities in my teaching.</blockquote>
</td>

<tr class="table_alt_row">
<td>Critical reflection</td>
<td>

<p>Demonstrates an awareness that actions and events are not only located in, and explicable by, reference to multiple perspectives but are located in, and influenced by multiple historical, and socio-political contexts. For example,</p>
<blockquote>What must be recognized, however, is that the issues of student management experienced with this class can only be understood within the wider structural locations of power relationships between teachers and students in schools as social institutions based on the principles of control&quot; (Smith, 1992)</blockquote>

 <!-- ******** Chapter:  4. Elements of reflection **********  -->

<div class="book_chapter"><a name="ch66001"></a>
<h2>4. Elements of reflection</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-24b9-e8dd-6823-a93390075fd2">As with the types of reflection discussed previously, the <em>elements</em> of reflection on this page are presented as a useful taxonomy to support your reflection during this course and beyond. It is not presented here as the single correct collection of reflection elements. The five elements presented here were identified by Ullmann et al (2012). Ullmann et al’s (2012) five elements of reflection are:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Description of an experience.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Personal experience.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Critical analysis.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Taking perspectives into account.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">An outcome of reflection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">In short, it can be useful to actively try and include these 5 elements in any reflection. Ullman et al (2012) do recognise that these are not necessarily five separate elements, there is overlap.  One example is that your description of an experience could include some critical analysis and an attempt to present multiple perspectives.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The following offers a short description of each element. Ullman et al (2012) offer an expanded version in Section 4 of their paper.</p>

</div>

<h3>4.1. Summary of the elements</h3>
<h4 dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-e932c713-24bb-00e0-e809-8ec58cf9052d">Description of experience</h4>
<p dir="ltr">What happened? Or perhaps in this course, what did you read, see or listen to?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The idea is to start your reflection by &quot;recalling and detailing the salient moments of the event&quot; (Ullmann et al, 2012, pp. 104). If you&#39;re reflecting on something you&#39;ve read, you might give a brief summary of its main point(s). Or, the points that are most salient to what you’re reflecting upon.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Personal experience</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The reflection should include your thoughts and feelings, based on the idea that reflection is a type of inner dialog.  It shouldn&#39;t just be a summary of what you read or experienced. It should aim to connect that experience with your existing knowledge, thoughts and feelings. It&#39;s appropriate to say you didn&#39;t understand, you disagreed or that you were confused or made angry. It’s ok to include emotion. Feel free to write it in the first person.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Critical analysis</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Description of what happened and your experience is not enough. You have to question your assumptions, values, beliefs and biases. You have to question the assumptions, values, beliefs and biases of what you&#39;ve experienced, read, seen or listened to. You might analyse, argue, evaluate, synthesise and test these assumptions etc. with other ideas and experiences. Look for inconsistencies, disagreement, commonality, reasons and justification. Think about how you can link and integrate ideas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More on this soon.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Take perspectives into account</h4>
<p dir="ltr">How you look at an experience or idea is important. Look to understand the perspective embedded in the experience, idea or yourself. Look for alternatives. Talk with others and see what they are thinking. Different ways of looking at a problem can reveal new ideas. This is also where different theoretical and conceptual models can offer assistance.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">An outcome</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Did you develop a new understanding through this process? Did you experience transformative learning? Or, did the experience confirm you existing understandings? What will you do know with this?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Summarise what you learned, offer some conclusions and make plans for how you will use this into the future. Does it link to a particular assessment task? Is there something further you need to read or think about? Change a teaching practice?</p>

<blockquote>After reviewing the Post-it notes together with the teachers, the discussions revealed that they tend to ‘jump’ to the research question when explaining their assumptions. The idea of the assumption step was to get the teachers to think about their kick-off issue and identify the beliefs they have about this issue.</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Given how the human mind works, it is no surprise that our assumptions take over. As identified by Hansen and Wasson (2016) it is important that we question our assumptions before going too far.</p>
<p dir="ltr">How do you do that?</p>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-0ecae6c0-24bc-1ace-2672-177ed85ac6d5">Brookfield (2009) suggests that (emphasis added)</p>
<blockquote><em>Reflection focuses on uncovering assumptions</em>, the conceptual glue that holds our perspectives, meaning schemes and habits of mind in place. People’s capacity for holding assumptions that contradict each other, and that are contradicted by events and experiences, knows no bounds. As Basseches (2005) illustrates, adults are able to move back and forth between asserting general assumptions that are viewed as guides for living (such as honesty is the best policy) and particular, context-specific assumptions that contradict the general ones (sometimes circumstances mean that lying about one’s real agenda or motivation is necessary for one to have any chance of success). The texts of our lives  our experiences and how we ascribe meaning to these  are the focus of assumption hunting. The internal grammar of these texts comprises the assumptions, and ways we assess the accuracy of these, that we develop to explain situations, solve problems and guide actions. We develop assumptions about the meaning that should be ascribed to other people’s words, assumptions about the significance of others’ behaviours, assumptions about how to solve problems we keep encountering, and assumptions to guide our choices, judgments and decisions. <em>Conceived this way critical reflection involves us recognising and researching the assumptions that undergird our thoughts and actions within relationships, at work, in community involvements, in avocational pursuits and as citizens. It takes the process outside the classroom and away from academic disciplines and divisions and places it squarely in the centre of our experiences</em> (p. 294-295)</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Even becoming aware of your assumptions is hard.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The critical analysis and other assumptions elements from Ullman et al (2012) are steps intended to help uncover, question and test assumptions. But how to do it?</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/usq/reader.action?docID=4790372&amp;ppg=1">Brookfield (2017)</a> identifies three broad categories of assumptions: paradigmatic, prescriptive and causal.

<p> </p>

<h3>For example</h3>

<h4>Causal assumption</h4>

<p>Brookfield (2017) lists the following causal assumption of his</p>
<blockquote>Making mistakes in front of students creates a trustful environment for learning in which students feel free to make errors with less fear of censure or embarrassment.</blockquote>

<p>On a somewhat related note, I believe that <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803052&amp;chapterid=65979">sharing the evolution</a> of my thinking around the ramble/learning path increases teacher presence, models practice, and shows a willingness to show my &quot;writing to think&quot;. My assumption/hope is that this will help improve your learning and also help address somewhat <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=798711&amp;chapterid=65794">the feelings of vulnerability</a> when students are asked to reveal their thinking through reflection.</p>
<h4>Prescriptive assumptions</h4>

<p>Underpinning the whole design of this course is the prescriptive assumption that tertiary teachers should engage in reflection and inquiry into student learning to become master teachers. And, there are many, many more.</p>
<h4>Paradigmatic assumptions</h4>

<p>In terms of <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803052&amp;chapterid=66007">issues for higher education</a>, Goodyear (2015) identified this issue</p>
<blockquote>Employers and their representatives are continuing to criticise universities for failing to produce work-ready graduates. Students themselves are questioning whether they are getting a fair return on the time and fees they are investing.</blockquote>

<p>A paradigmatic assumption underpinning this issue is that the role of the University is to produce work-ready graduates. To help students get a job. Some argue that this represents a broader paradigmatic shift within society, a shift that many are unhappy with. It&#39;s an assumption that has not always held for universities.</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<h4>The task</h4>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the aim this week is for you to start thinking about the first stages of your inquiry into learning and teaching. The initiation of kick-off stage has been described this way</p>
<blockquote>A possible scenario for the integrated model follows Carla, a chemistry and mathematics teacher in an Upper secondary school. Her analysis of students’ assessment last year suggested some common misconceptions in the understanding of converging series. This year she decided to inquire this problem more thoroughly. She consults the integrated model to plan her teacher research project. The Initiation was her realization of the students’ misconceptions. (Emin-Martinez et al, 2014, p. 8)</blockquote>
<blockquote>the Kick-off, which is when a teacher first identifies the issues related to student learning in which s/he is interested (Hansen and Wasson, 2016, p. 39)</blockquote>
<blockquote>Identify something you would like to know about student learning? Something you wonder about? E.g., Why are some of the students not learning the material? What do the students think about my new learning materials? (Hansen and Wasson, 2016, p. 44)</blockquote>
<h4>The problem</h4>

<p>But as mentioned before our assumptions limit how we think about these issues, Hansen and Wasson (2016) again</p>
<blockquote>After reviewing the Post-it notes together with the teachers, the discussions revealed that they tend to ‘jump’ to the research question when explaining their assumptions. The idea of the assumption step was to get the teachers to think about their kick-off issue and identify the beliefs they have about this issue. (p. 43)</blockquote>
<h4>The solution</h4>

<p><a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803179&amp;chapterid=66004"> The previous book</a> in this learning path suggested a process of critical reflection as a way to identify and question assumptions. One of the steps in that process the use of literature and included the suggestion that &quot;relevant scholarly literature can provide findings and theories that offer alternate assumptions&quot;.</p>

<p>This book introduces three different lenses from the scholarly literature as examples.</p>

<div class="book_chapter"><a name="ch66012"></a>
<h2>2. On Theory</h2>

<p>If your background is not within education, then educational theory can be a deep and frightening forest to navigate. The following provides <em>one</em> specific &quot;map&quot; to understanding what educational theory is and why we use it.</p>

<p>Hirst (2012) describes educational theory as</p>
<blockquote>A domain of practical theory, concerned with formulating and justifying principles of action for a range of practical activities. (p. 3)</blockquote>

<p>i.e. educational theory should help you teach and help your learners learn. It can help you identify reasons why you should (or shouldn&#39;t) use different practices.</p>
<h4>Why use theories?</h4>

<p>Thomas (1997) cites Mouly (1978)</p>
<blockquote>Theory is a convenience a necessity, really organizing a whole slough of facts, laws, concepts, constructs, principles into a meaningful and manageable form (p. 78)</blockquote>

<p>These theories are useful because they help you understand, formulate and justify how and what to do. Learning, teaching is difficult Theories should help you make sense of this complexity. Guide you in understanding, planning, implementing and evaluating of your use of ICTs. Theories provide you knowledge.</p>

<p>Bates (2015)</p>
<blockquote>With a knowledge of alternative theoretical approaches, teachers and instructors are in a better position to make choices about how to approach their teaching in ways that will best fit the perceived needs of their students, within the very many different learning contexts that teachers and instructors face (pp. 44-45)</blockquote>

<p>Right now, we&#39;re interested in using educational theory as a lens to surface your assumptions and provide alternate assumptions as a way to understand issues you might like to explore more.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>3. Three lenses to surface assumptions</h2>

<p>The following introduces three different lenses (theories, frameworks, models etc) and suggests that they can be useful for identifying ways of looking at learning and teaching (assumptions). These are by no means the only three, or even the most useful three. (the most useful would be very contextual).</p>

<h3>3.1. Constructive alignment and 3 levels of teaching</h3>


<div class="dj_figure"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/3302564430/" title="Levels of thinking about learning and teaching"><img alt="Levels of thinking about learning and teaching" height="225" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3332/3302564430_3dcf6bb679_m.jpg" width="240"></a></div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_alignment">Constructive alignment</a> is an idea from Biggs (2003) that is in widespread use across higher education. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_design">Backward design</a> is another related idea.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.daimi.au.dk/~brabrand/short-film/">Teaching Teaching &amp; Understanding Understanding</a> is a short (19 minutes) film produced to explain the major ideas within constructive alignment. Biggs (2012) is a journal paper that offers an overview of the same. Rather than focus on all of the ideas underpinning constructive alignment,  the focus here will be on the three levels of teaching proposed as part of constructive alignment and summarised in the image to the right taken from the &quot;teaching teaching&quot; short film.</p>

<p>The idea is that these levels each represent a particular set of assumptions that guide how teachers teach.</p>
<h4>Level 1 - What students are</h4>

<p>The assumption what the students are (and the differences between them) are the most important influence on student outcomes. The job of the teacher is deliver the information, the job of the students is to engage with it, and if a student can&#39;t, then it&#39;s their fault. The problem can&#39;t have been with the teaching, the information was transmitted effectively.</p>
<h4>Level 2 - What teachers do</h4>

<p>The assumption here is that improvements in student learning outcomes can be achieved by improving how the teacher transmits the information. i.e. the behaviour and tactics adopted by the teacher can improve student learning. Biggs (2012) gives the following as examples of the types of prescriptive advice given to teachers at this level</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>establish clear procedural rules at the outset, such as signals for silence;</li>
<li>ensure clarity: project the voice, clear visual aids;</li>
<li>eye-contact students while talking;</li>
<li>don’t interrupt a large lecture with handouts: chaos is likely</li>
</ul>

<p>This advice, useful as it is, is concerned with management, not with facilitating learning. Good management is important for setting the stage for good learning to take place – not as an end in itself. (p. 44)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Level 3 - What students do</h4>

<p>Hopefully you realise that this is seen as the &quot;good&quot; level. This level is based on the assumption that student learning can only arise from what the student does. Biggs (2012) quotes Shuell (1986)</p>
<blockquote>If students are to learn desired outcomes in a reasonably effective manner, then the teacher’s fundamental task is to get students to engage in learning activities that are likely to result in their achieving those outcomes. . . . It is helpful to remember that what the student does is actually more important in determining what is learned than what the teacher does (p. 429).</blockquote>

<h2>2. Mapping blog posts and assessment tasks</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65155#a">Assignment 1, Part A</a> - like most of the assessment tasks for this course - includes the following requirement (emphasis added)</p>
<blockquote>The critical analysis of your conceptions of good teaching practice will be undertaken through a series of reflections that reflect on and <strong>build upon the analysis contained in your personal blog posts from earlier in the semester</strong> on assumptions and conceptions of teaching practice</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-257f-c4d9-37f2-bb260476b33e">Each of the assessment tasks are directly connected to blog posts that you will be encouraged to “write to think” during the semester. The idea is that by the time you start work on your assessment tasks you should have a small (large?) collection of blog posts to inform your blog post (essay) for each assessment task.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Mapping your progress</h4>
<p dir="ltr">One way to ensure you have a collection of blog posts would be to map your “write to think” blog posts against the specific assessment tasks.  i.e. have some way you can quickly see how many &quot;write to think&quot; posts you&#39;ve written for each assessment, so you are aware of your progress.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You could do this manually, or you could make use of software to help.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Blog categories</h4>
<p dir="ltr">One approach to doing this is via categories or tags on your blog. These are ways of allocating a blog post to a particular collection. You could have one collection for each assessment task and you could then easily track progress.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you’re using Wordpress for your blog, then <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/posts/categories/">categories can</a> be used to group related posts together. </p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, I use categories on my blog to group posts related to particular courses. For example, all my <a href="http://djon.es/blog/category/teaching/edu8702/">EDU8702 blog posts</a> (very small number) or all my <a href="http://djon.es/blog/category/edc3100/">EDC3100 blog posts</a> (a course I taught for 5 years).</p>

<h2>3. Planning for Assignment 1, Part A</h2>

<p><a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65155#a">Assignment 1, Part A</a> asks you to identify a particular discipline into which you teach. The discipline you choose should be used throughout the course. Subsequent assessment tasks will build on the work you do in Assignment 1, Part A.</p>

<p>Already in this learning path <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803052&amp;chapterid=65997">you&#39;ve been asked</a> to share some details about your teaching context. It&#39;s time to start thinking about finalising your context and discipline. You can&#39;t make any significant progress on Assignment 1 until you do.</p>
<h4>Literature review</h4>

<p>You will need to undertake a literature review of the teaching in your discipline. The USQ library offers <a href="https://www.usq.edu.au/learningcentre/assignment-skills/planning-assignments/literature-review">this advice</a> on writing literature reviews. Based on this advice, consider Assignment 1, Part A at the upper-end of the undergraduate level in terms of the number of references you should look to include.</p>


<div class="dj_task" id="connect">


<div class="dj_task_title">

<p>Start planning</p>
</div>


<div class="dj_activity">

<p>The following questions are offered to get you started on Assignment 1, Part A.</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What is your teaching discipline?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What is your specific context? First year? Second? A particular course or sub-discipline? (e.g. computer programming)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Identify what you need to know about teaching in your discipline?</p>
</li>
<ol type="i">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Where is the best literature around teaching in your discipline?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Are there related disciplines?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What are its current and important issues?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What is its history? Have there been any evolution in understanding?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What are the assumptions underpinning teaching in your discipline?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Start planning out your literature review, examine the above questions, add some more and start thinking about how you’ll go about answering those questions.  Write a blog post outlining your plan.</p>
