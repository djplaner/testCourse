<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-46c4f8b4-074e-3860-d025-ccb75d722f03">It’s been argued that a good research question won’t ensure a quality research investigation, but a poor research question will make it significantly more difficulty to achieve a quality research investigation. The aim of this week’s learning path is to help you develop a good quality answer to this week’s driving question</p>
<blockquote>Which research question will I answer?</blockquote>

<p>You may already have an idea of what research question you might like to answer. As <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803052&amp;chapterid=65976">explained earlier in the course</a>, the Initiation phase of the TISL model can be sparked by a particular challenge, interest or question. By the end of this week you will have revisited that spark, perhaps reframed it, and made some progress in identifying the research question you will focus on answering for the rest of the course (<a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65156">Assignment 2</a>, Parts <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65156#a">A</a> &amp; <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65156#b">B</a>).</p>
<h4>Is the research question important?</h4>

<p>Since this course is informed by the Teacher Inquiry into Student Learning (TISL) literature, let&#39;s see what that literature says about research questions.</p>

<p>Hansel and Wasson (2016) suggest that</p>
<blockquote>One key to using student learning for developing one’s own practice is the ability to find research questions driven by one’s own interests, which imparts the ownership of questions and findings. (pp. 29-30)</blockquote>

<p>And later they write</p>
<blockquote>Literature within the field suggests that the formulation of a question is key to the teacher inquiry process, and that the question is rooted in practice ... focused on student learning....The research question feeds into the heart of the TISL Heart, the Method, which expounds how to collect student data to answer the research question. (p. 39)</blockquote>

<h2>2. Starting points</h2>

<p>The assumption for the following activity is that you have already been giving some serious thought to the particular learning and teaching context that will be the focus of your TISL.  While it isn’t necessary to have finalised on which context you will use (just yet), you should be looking at achieving this by the end of this learning path. </p>

<h2>3. Some example good research questions</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-46c4f8b4-0755-6dda-f8d9-cef9f7b28f03">TISL is a refinement and specific form of teacher research. Emin-martinez et al (2014) define it as</p>
<blockquote>a systemic approach to teacher inquiry, has its roots in “insider view” approaches such as critical inquiry, action research, and teacher research, where teachers conduct their own research, in real classrooms and school settings, focusing on local practices. (p. 2)</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Meaning that not all good research questions would be considered good quality research questions for TISL. The origins of TISL within teacher research and subsequently action research means that research questions from those settings are more appropriate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The following sample of good research questions are adapted from Caro-Bruce (2000, p. 86). As you can probably tell these take a focus on classroom research in primary and secondary settings. While the specific questions may be less than appropriate to a tertiary context, their features as a research question do apply well to TISL within a tertiary context.</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-46c4f8b4-0764-7e8d-8283-1e9cf0967f42">So far this week you’ve examined some example good questions and been asked to analyse those questions against a sample set of criteria. You started this week be responding to some starting points that might help you identify research questions relevant to your context.  The aim of this part of the learning path is to provide some additional activities and abstract conceptualisations to help you refine these initial starting points into a good quality, specific question.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Some notes on “research”</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Before you start focusing on the specifics of developing your research question, time to contextualise the use of the term research.</p>

<div class="dj_task">


<div class="dj_task_title">

<p>Reading</p>
</div>


<div class="dj_activity">Read from the heading <em>A few principles for conducting action research</em> (bottom of p. 236) through the heading <em>Identifying the research question</em> (near the top of p. 237) in Pine (2009). In particular, the first paragraph at the bottom of page 236.</div>
</div>

<p> </p>

<p>This paragraph sums up nicely the perspective of <em>research</em> adopted within TISL. The focus here is not on establishing whether or not a particular intervention will work perfect in all contexts. You will not be engaged in large double-blind, randomised control trials as part of your work in TISL.  The focus of TISL is in discovering and inventing what will work within your context.</p></div>

<div class="dj_activity">
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-46c4f8b4-0766-9f02-4881-3cf44dddebf6">Read the section <em>Identifying the Research Question</em> from Pine (2009, pp. 237-239).  As you do, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Where might research questions emerge from?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What does identifying a good research question involve?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">How many of these activities and practices do you participate within?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Do any of the 8 passions presented engage your passions? What are you passionate about in your teaching context?</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-46c4f8b4-0766-e428-04fb-e8145631c9d8">Hopefully the starting points section in this reading reminded you of something from this learning path.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pine (2009) made the point that identifying a research question is recursive and iterative. Finding the right question for you at this time from the “almost infinite number of research questions” is not straight-forward, takes some time, consideration and reflection, and is liable to change.</p></div>

</p>

<p>Earlier in the learning path <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=816696">you were introduced</a> to a set of criteria for good research questions adapted from Caro-Bruce (2000). The following reading reinforces and hopefully expands your insight into what makes for a good research question.</p>


<div class="dj_task">

<p>Reading</p>
</div>


<div class="dj_activity">
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-46c4f8b4-0768-f737-777f-9c9aabe9e831">Read the section <em>Characteristics of good research questions</em> from Pine (2009, pp. 239-241)</p>
<p dir="ltr">As you read through this section actively update the criteria for good research questions you were provided with earlier. Add criteria, add descriptions, or add examples from the Pine (2009) reading as appropriate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, do you think the earlier criteria effectively captures the following advice about good research questions from Pine (2009):</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">“benefits your students by informing your teaching and the curriculum, by providing new insights about students and their learning, by broadening and deepening your perspectives, or by improving practice” (p. 239)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A good research question leads to action that makes a difference.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<p> </p>

<p>Again in this reading, Pine (2009) reinforces the value of not being overly wedded to a particular question. Changing questions, in a process like TISL, can be of significant value. </p></div>

 <!-- ******** Chapter:  4. Focus on the students, not the teacher **********  -->

<h2>4. Focus on the students, not the teacher</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-46c4f8b4-076a-698e-eec8-aa0d184e9133">Pine (2009) makes a point of emphasising the point that teacher research should have a focus on benefiting students. It is important that your research question and all that you write about your TISL should illustrate this focus on improving student learning or the student experience. In doing this, the language you use is important. The following provides a few simple pointers and examples to illustrate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Which of the following descriptions do you think has more a focus on student learning, rather than the teacher and teaching.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I taught the course EDC3100, ICT and Pedagogy for five years.</p>

<p>Over a five year period I have helped over 1000 students learn how to use ICT to enhance and transform their pedagogy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Language should focus on students and what they are learning, rather than the content or course you are teaching.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Before we start that section, time to look at Pine’s (2009) advice</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-4d806c90-076d-f8ae-777d-8e3357a45242">The following offers a sequence of activities intended to help you answer this week’s driving question</p>
<blockquote>Which research question will I answer?</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">While you can choose not to engage with the activities, you will need to be able to answer this week’s driving question. Since developing a research question is a key phase in the approach to TISL adopted in this course, you will need to develop a research question. The rubric for <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65156#b">Assignment 2, Part B</a> explicitly mentions the need for a research question.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As mentioned in Pine (2009) and other sources, maintaining a journal (e.g. your blog) can be a useful and important tool for successful teacher research. As is engaging in on-going critical reflection. For these reasons it is suggested that you use your blog to make explicit, share and reflect upon the recursive and complex process of finalising your research question.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To help you step through that complex process, the following activities are suggested:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Finalise your context</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Expand upon your starting points</p>

<script src="https://djon.es/edu8702_macro.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</p>

<p> An important step in the TISL process is questioning assumptions. We are invariably influenced by our assumptions. Your research questions will be a product of your assumptions. Before going to much further it is important that you think clearly about the beliefs and assumptions that underpin your questions.</p>


<div class="dj_task">
