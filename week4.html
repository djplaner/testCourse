<h2>1. Where are we?</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-19e3ba78-6f46-b29c-5e5d-011918990c56">Last week’s learning path introduced the idea of emerging practice. It also looked at one of the emerging practices associated with teacher inquiry into student learning <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=798714&amp;chapterid=65799">identified by Emin-Martinez et al (2014)</a> - learning design. This week’s learning path examines the other example of emerging practice identified by Emin-Martinez et al (2014) - learning analytics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Learning analytics can potentially play an important part of your work on a number of assignment components, especially <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65155#b">Assignment 1, Part B</a> (the next two weeks will focus on Part B for assignment 1 more). This week the focus is on you answering this week’s driving question for your discipline and context</p>
<blockquote>How might I apply learning analytics? Should I?</blockquote>

 <!-- ******** Chapter:  1. Introduction **********  -->

<div class="book_chapter"><a name="ch66274"></a>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-fdd2ad6b-6edb-328e-7b8c-db5744a1a567">Have you heard the term <em>learning analytics</em> used before this course? It’s become one of the major areas of interests (a fad?) within higher education over the last 10 years or so. <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=806043&amp;chapterid=66129">The 2017 Horizon Report</a> mentions learning analytics as part of its <em>Growing Focus on Measuring Learning</em> trend. But do you know what learning analytics is? Have you used it, or seen it used? The driving question for this week is</p>
<blockquote>How might I apply learning analytics? Should I?</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">There are a couple of reasons why these questions are relevant to you. First, learning analytics is a strongly emerging practice in higher education. Being more aware of what it is and how (and if) it might be used is important for a tertiary educator. Second, as you’ve hopefully seen so far, Mor et al (2015) and others position learning analytics as part of a “virtuous circle” (p. 221) with learning design and teacher inquiry into student learning.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Some real life examples</h4>
<p dir="ltr">In the <em>experiencing</em> stage of this week’s learning path you will engage with two examples of how learning analytics have been used by tertiary educators.  These two examples are:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Video of a Hazel Jones - an Educational Designer and PhD student - talking about how she’s helped tertiary educators use learning analytics across a number of universities.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">An exploration of what learning analytics suggests about learner activity in this course.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-6edc-abdc-ea0b-2cf2fd486a87"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hazeljjones/?ppe=1">Hazel Jones</a> is an <a href="https://staffprofile.usq.edu.au/profile/Hazel-Jones">educational designer</a> and PhD candidate at USQ. Hazel has a history of working in Australian Higher Education supporting tertiary educators, including with the use of learning analytics. This last has became a passion of Hazel’s and led to <a href="https://learninganalyticslady.wordpress.com/">her PhD topic</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the following video talks about her approach, thoughts and experiences of helping tertiary educators make use of learning analytics.  You can watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/226525600">the video</a> all in one go (see below) or dip into the sections of the video that interest you the most.</p>

<h2>3. EDU8702 and learning analytics</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-2afbd905-6ee2-cd42-56fd-e19a62cd53aa">The aim in the following pages is to provide you with some experience of what it feels like to be experiencing learning analytics from the learner perspective. This is done by providing a brief overview of some of the different learning analytics related services that are available within this context and how they have (or haven’t) been used.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond the theoretical value (as per <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=784358&amp;chapterid=65299">Kolb’s experiential cycle)</a> of providing you with real example of the topic of conversation this week. I believe that - even a limited - experience of learning analytics as a student will provide you with a unique insight into learning analytics and I hope this will positively inform how you might make use of learning analytics in your own practice.</p>

<h3>3.1. Why I use learning analytics - know thy student</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-aa41b877-6ee4-aa92-bf2f-835a28c0a66b">As outlined in <a href="http://djon.es/blog/2015/09/15/helping-teachers-know-thy-students/">this blog post</a>, my use of learning analytics to date has been primarily driven with the aim of increasing my ability to “know thy student” and in particular to have some idea about how and if they are engaging with the course. In this way my use of learning analytics <a href="https://vimeo.com/226525600#t=1m16s">echoes the metaphor</a> that Hazel introduced in the discussion of her practice with learning analytics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Intellectually and through experience I have learned that the use of learning analytics described her only provide very broad indications of how students are engaging with the course. They can never capture the full richness of this practice, especially given the nature of the technology.  But the available analytics do provide a small improvement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is especially so in a course of 300+ students. The context in which much of my current practice originated. Consequently, the value of that practice in this course with 4 students is under consideration.</p>

</div>

 <!-- ******** Sub-chapter:  3.2. Activity completion **********  -->

<div class="book_chapter"><a name="ch66278"></a>
<h3>3.2. Activity completion</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-6ee5-97ca-0cc4-436e932cfc1d">You may have noticed that each of the little boxes next to activities and resources on the course Study Desk. Depending on your progress, some of these boxes may have ticks in them. These ticks indicated that you have - according to the software - completed the activity. “Completion” typically involves visiting each of the pages in a Moodle book or posting the requested number of posts to a discussion forum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is a Moodle feature called <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/33/en/Activity_completion">Activity Completion</a>. As part of that feature Moodle stores information about which learners have completed which tasks and provides reports that allow teaching staff to view those records.  The following image shows part of the report for this course (it includes some of the teaching staff).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Activity completion - with a designed course site - can provide an indication of what students have completed and perhaps learned. In large courses, I’ve found this very useful when answering questions from students. Knowing whether they’ve accessed an activity/resource related to the question can guide the discussion with the student.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the course activities/resources aren’t split up like this, then the value of activity completion is reduced.</p>

<h3>3.3. Activity report</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-6ee6-5888-cf83-2c62382c4e8e">Activity completion described on the previous page captures information about activity that is at a slightly higher level of abstraction. Moodle (like most LMS systems) also provides <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/33/en/Activity_report">an Activity Report</a>. For each activity and resource within the course website, the activity report shows the number of times it has been viewed and the number of users who have viewed it.  The following image shows part of the Activity Report for this course.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the drawbacks of this report is that it shows activity by both staff and students. This makes it difficulty - especially in this course - to understand how the students are using the resources. Another drawback is that it exists separate from the course website.  Later in this book you’ll be shown another view of the same data that is more usable.</p>

 <!-- ******** Sub-chapter:  3.4. Logs and clickstreams **********  -->

<hr>

<div class="book_chapter"><a name="ch66280"></a>
<h3>3.4. Logs and clickstreams</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-6ee7-0e82-7246-a55fde51b71e">Moodle is able to generate the Activity Report because it - like all other LMS - record every click you and I make in the LMS. This is recorded in a log. This data can be called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickstream">a clickstream</a>. Moodle allows teaching staff to examine the clickstream for particular resources, activities and users.  The following image shows part of the Log report from Moodle for this course showing the activities I was doing while generating the images for this book.  </p>
<p dir="ltr">From this image you can gain an idea of the information recorded, which includes: who clicked on what resource/activity; the type of activity the click is associated with; when the click happened; and the IP address from which the click originated. This is not data that provides a lot of insight into learning, just when and what link has been clicked on. However, the large number of clicks that are generated in many courses become quite large, hence the use of the term big data.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The nature of this type of data - the foundation for a lot of learning analytics, but not all - troubles many people.  For example, Lodge &amp; Lewis (2012) write</p>
<blockquote>The reductionist approach to what is a complex phenomenon is akin to behaviourist approaches used to understand learning in the 20th Century. Are we at risk of treating learning in a higher education context as being analogous to a rat pressing a lever? Yes as we can „measure‟ it, or no, as it does not make meaning out of complex notions such as learning in adulthood, learning for professional preparation, learning as research training, learning as development and growth, learning as being-in-the-world?</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">As will be shown below, I only use clickstream data to provide a broad indication of what is happening. It can provide an early indicator of potential issues or benefits. For example, if many students are clicking many times on the one explanation of a topic, this potentially suggests that the explanation is not working. What it does mean becomes a topic for further exploration.</p>

<h3>3.5. Different representations</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-a7c2c1d4-6ee8-7c87-986e-f742b44b4670">Any value from large amounts of fine-grain data of the type contained in clickstreams can be generated from different representations. Moodle provides a statistics report that provides a time-based visualisation of the information available in the activity report.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The following image shows that report for this course. This report does split activity amongst the different user roles. It allows you to see that the examiner (me) spent most of my time clicking on the site on around the 25th June, 3rd July and 10th July (Sundays and Mondays). This matches the times when I’m updating the course site with new learning paths.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve never used this particular representation in my teaching practice.  However, in large courses it could be useful for identifying peak times of usage. In turn, this might influence decisions about when certain learning events are scheduled.</p>

<h3>3.6. Improving LMS activities</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-6ee9-8f0d-4d5c-47e19facfc47">The generic learning analytics tools provided by LMS tend to be fairly simple (though they are improving). I rarely use those tools myself. Preferring tools that are more useful and contextually appropriate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of those tools is called <a href="https://github.com/damoclark/mav-enterprise">the Moodle Activity Viewer (MAV)</a>. MAV was developed by a colleague of mine at CQUniversity and we’ve written about it <a href="https://github.com/damoclark/mav-enterprise">(Jones and Clark, 2014)</a>. The following images show the course website modified by MAV to enable me to see the number of clicks or students who have accessed a particular link in Moodle. If I click on the one of the links provided by MAV, it will also show me which students have and which have not accessed an activity or resource.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MAV generates colours based on a heatmap. The redder a colour, the hotter something is meaning that more students have clicked on it. In the images below you may be able to see that the <em>Create your blog</em> resource and <em>Register your blog</em> activity are coloured using a slightly redder colour. Indicating a great level of activity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the advantages of MAV is that it works on and page in Moodle. Meaning in a discussion forum it is possible to see which posts people are visiting more than others. This makes MAV very useful for gaining an understanding of how particular learning designs are working.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Clicks</h4>

<h3>3.7. Analytics from outside the LMS - Videos</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-6eec-6ae2-f26d-d66cbace7eea">Analytics are not limited to LMS. All contemporary digital systems have clickstream logs, collect other data, and provide reports.  The following image are of the analytics provided by Vimeo. Vimeo is the video hosting platform that is hosting the videos for EDU8702 such as the <a href="https://vimeo.com/222990772">welcome video</a> or <a href="https://vimeo.com/226525600">the video of Hazel’s discussion</a> of learning analytics used earlier in this learning path.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What this particular report shows is the number of times that the <a href="https://vimeo.com/222990772">EDU8702 welcome video</a> has been played and finished. What it shows is that one person started playing the video on the 3rd of July but did not complete the video.  It shows that two people started playing the video on the 9th of July. One of these people played the video to the finish. Whether or not any of these people actually watched the video (let alone learned anything from it) can’t be known.</p>

As an emerging practice that is potentially promises to modify some of the assumptions upon which educational practice is based, the task of understanding learning analytics is a complex one.

<h2>2. Learning analytics and Teacher inquiry</h2>

<p>This course is based on the assumption that teacher-led inquiry into student learning is an effective method for becoming a master teacher. In the first learning path <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=798713&amp;chapterid=65798">you were introduced</a> to the notion of teacher inquiry and the virtuous circle that it forms with learning design and learning analytics. This was largely done through reading Mor et al (2015).</p>


<div class="dj_task">


<div class="dj_task_title">

<p>Revisit Mor et al (2015) and learning analytics</p>
</div>


<div class="dj_activity">

<p>It would appear timely to revisit what Mor et al (2015) had to say about learning analytics. It starts of page 223 with the paragraph starting with</p>
<blockquote>The data-informed approach to teacher inquiry, a key quality of TISL, is part of a wider trend in education, towards the use of data and analytics to inform educational practice. Learning analytics are defined as</blockquote>

<p>and finishes with on page 224</p>

<p>As you revisit, ponder the following questions</p>
<ol>
<li>How is learning analytics defined?</li>
<li>Where did learning analytics come from?</li>
<li>What are some of the uses to which learning analytics can be put?</li>
<li>What are the potential benefits of learning analytics?</li>
<li>What is the problem identified with learning analytics tools?</li>
</ol>

<p>Later, Mor et al (2015) identify that &quot;learning analytics faces considerable challenges, some of which could be addressed by a closer dialogue with learning design and TISL&quot; (p. 225). Re-reading these few paragraphs may also be useful.</p>

<h3>3.2. Three educational data sources</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-6f32-b927-10c1-1767e04bee4b">In the next section, Cope and Kalantzis (2016) seek to classify the sources of evidence of learning that are available in digital learning environments.  This overview provides a useful lens for understanding different types of learning analytics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, you could use this lens for analysing the example uses of learning analytics introduced in the <em>experiencing</em> section of this learning path. If you did, you would find that all of these example learning analytics fit within just one of the types of educational data source identified by Cope and Kalantzis (2016). Suggesting that my current practice is only scratching the surface of the possibilities raised by learning analytics.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://djon.es/blog/2013/02/25/the-assessment-of-learning-journals-ideas-for-bim/">This blog post</a> from 2013 outlines some initial thinking behind the integration of a learning journal assessment item into an undergraduate course that I (David) taught. It includes the following thought about future work</p>
<blockquote>Explore and integrate the work of Ullman et al (2012) in automatically detecting reflective texts.</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">This is the same Ullman et al (2012) <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803179&amp;chapterid=66001">introduced earlier</a> in this course in the context of <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803179&amp;chapterid=66001">elements of reflection</a>.

<h2>4. Critiques of learning analytics</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-6f35-da5e-2726-326054c9b6d9">As mentioned earlier it is important not to accept emerging practices at face value. It is important to question and evaluate. This book provides some pointers to a sample of the critical views of learning analytics and related notions. A taste and some pointers for further exploration.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://solaresearch.org/hla-17/hla17-chapter1">Kop, Fournier, &amp; Durand (2017)</a> provide a more detailed and specific critical perspective on learning analytics. In particular, they identify questions “about truth, control, transparency, and power in big data studies” along with “inherent fallacies and biases” and “methodological concerns related to data cleaning, data selection and interpretation” (Kop et al, 2017, p. 324).</p>

<h3>4.1. 6 provocations for big data</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-ce188116-6f36-e27c-372f-7d4c0de460aa">boyd and Crawford (2012) offer six provocations for big data in their article <em>Critical Questions for Big Data</em>.  They examine big data in a much broader context than just higher education. However, those six provocations do provide useful prompts for thinking about learning analytics in higher education. The six provocations are</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Big data changes the definition of knowledge.<br class="kix-line-break">For some big data represents a transformative shift in knowledge and knowing. A claim that is still questionable, especially if it is seen as excluding existing perspectives and practices of the same. While the new perspective may offer useful insights, it too will have its own limitations and issues.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Claims to objectivity and accuracy are misleading</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Bigger data are not always better data.<br class="kix-line-break">Having huge amounts of data does not there are no bias or other issues hidden with the data and its interpretation.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Taken out of context, Big Data loses its meaning.<br class="kix-line-break">There’s a limited to generalisability of learning analytics. Gašević et al (2015) identify how “lack of attention to instructional conditions can lead to an over or under estimation” of the value of learning analytics.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Just because it is accessible does not make it ethical.<br class="kix-line-break">What is ethical use of data in learning analytics in higher education? Prinsloo, Paul &amp; Slade, Sharon (2017) provide some insights into current thinking about this question.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Limited access to Big Data creates new digital divides.<br class="kix-line-break">Who has the resourcing and skills to harness big data? How does this restrict access and involvement?</p>

<h3>4.2. Stating the obvious</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-4fb09387-6f37-7fc7-427a-917ccf877704">An example of some of the potential issues arising from the 6 provocations and learning analytics is provided in this blog post (the whole blog post is restricted by a registration requirement, for this reason I don’t expect you to read the whole post, but feel free to do so).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The blog post reports on a number of “big data” research studies into learning from Khan Academy, Udacity/San Jose State University, and Google Course Builder (e.g. this study).  The common theme from these studies is summarised in this quote from the <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/41929.pdf">Google Course Builder study</a>.</p>
<blockquote>our research indicates that learners who complete activities are more likely to complete the course than peers who completed no activities</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">This does seem to be a rather obvious conclusion. Justin Reich seems to think so given the scathing assessment of the research he gives in the blog post.  It leads him to suggest Reich’s law</p>
<blockquote>students who do stuff in a MOOC or other online learning environment will, on average, do more stuff than those who don&#39;t do stuff, and students who do stuff will perform better on stuff than those who don&#39;t do stuff.</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">And suggest it is so well established, that no further research (big data or otherwise) is required.</p>

<h2>1. How might you?</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-6f41-5c88-ed2c-4b43ac3c44c0">This learning path has been designed to help you answer this week’s driving questions</p>
<blockquote>How might I apply learning analytics? Should I?</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">It’s now time for you to explicitly think about answer these questions. At least in terms of the assessment for this course.  </p>
<p dir="ltr">Potentially, learning analytics might be useful in at least the following assignment components.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65155#b">Assignment 1, Part B</a> - How can I evaluate a learning and teaching episode?<br class="kix-line-break">As shown in the page linking learning analytics and teacher inquiry, applications of learning analytics may help you analyse and evaluate a past learning and teaching episode.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65156#b">Assignment 2, Part </a>B - How do I plan to implement and evaluate my chosen emerging practice?<br class="kix-line-break">Similarly, learning analytics may become an important component of your plan to design and evaluate your emerging practice.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65156#c">Assignment 2, Part </a>C - How will I become a master teacher?<br class="kix-line-break">Lastly, analytics could become a useful tool to help you continue your journey toward being a master teacher.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">But there’s no need to examine all those right now. A more immediate focus are the driving questions for this week.</p>
