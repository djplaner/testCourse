<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-6180dbfb-e3f3-ebc1-5a27-559b1b1b4901">Last week, we investigated the components of evaluation and how the align to create a strong evaluation plan. In this week, we continue learning about evaluation, but with a more practical focus on developing a plan to evaluate a teaching episode, which is the crux of <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65155#b">Assignment 1, Part B</a>. Our driving question is the same as last week:</p>
<blockquote>How might I evaluate my teaching practice?</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">To start with, let’s use a concrete example of an evaluation of a teaching episode. In the following discussion, the teaching episode is the online content of a course.</p>

<h2>3. Evaluating online teaching at USQ</h2>

<p>At USQ, there is a document called <a href="https://lor.usq.edu.au/usq/integ/gen/bb035aed-b503-40ec-8fdf-49b7341d5e73/0/?attachment.uuid=83036aa4-71cc-4eb6-a4fe-b035ed223656">StudyDesk Design &amp; Implementation Expectations</a> that is used to evaluate a course’s StudyDesk. This document outlines the “expectations” of a StudyDesk and provides a rubric to evaluate a course’s online presence. It is commonly used by some support teams and can be used by the course examiner to undertake a self-assessment of their StudyDesk.</p>

<h2>2. Designing evaluations</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-e423-0689-c28e-18c2acedba9d">Designing an evaluation can be as simple or complex as required based on the purpose of the evaluation. For example, if you simply want to know “How did my students like the interview an expert section in learning analytics?”, then you could design a feedback tool or or form that asks them that simple question and uses a Likert scale for responses with a free text comment section. However, evaluations can also be significantly more complex as you saw in the StudyDesk Expectations document in the Experience and Examine books.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The critical aspect that underpins the simplicity or complexity lies in the purpose of the evaluation: Why are you evaluating this teaching episode - for what benefit?</p>
<p dir="ltr">To begin, it is worthwhile to review some approaches to evaluation from a program perspective. The <a href="http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ913600.pdf">article by Ross (2010)</a> presents an overview of designing a program evaluation as a tool for reform, which is a larger goal than evaluating a teaching episode. However, pages 482–484 provide a clear overview of five approaches that are good to bear in mind as you design your evaluation.</p>

 <!-- ******** Chapter:  3. Foundational components of an evaluation document **********  -->

<hr>

<div class="book_chapter"><a name="ch66654"></a>
<h2>3. Foundational components of an evaluation document</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-e424-b6a6-703e-789c37a33544">There are three foundational components to structuring a formal evaluation document. These are the evaluation criteria, indicators of these criteria, and evidence for these criteria.</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Evaluation criteria;</p>

<p>The criteria that are used to evaluate whether or the degree to which something has been effective, implemented, etc. These are the “big” parts of the evaluation - the combined criteria will form the foundation of the evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Indicators; and,</p>

<p>The indicators are different aspects of each criteria that work together to provide an overall picture of whether the criteria has been met, or to what degree the criteria has been met.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Evidence.</p>

<p>This supports each of the indicators to demonstrate competence, degree of competence, or lack thereof, of each indicator. These combine to provide an overall view of the criteria.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">As an example, in the StudyDesk Expectations evaluation rubric, there are ten criteria, and each criterion has between three and nine indicators that help the evaluator determine what level of standard is being demonstrated in a StudyDesk. In the following image, you can see that the criteria is “Legal and institutional requirements are addressed”. There are four indicators (4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4) that are rated on their degree of presence (yes, no, partly) and that will help the evaluator determine to what degree this criteria is being addressed (rating of needs work, developing, good practice, or exemplary). The evidence can be placed into the “comments” box at the bottom. Finally, the rating can be determined based on how well the indicators are being met. Note that the ratings are described at the beginning of this evaluation rubric and are presented below the annotated table.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/35769878313/in/dateposted-public/" title="Components of an evaluation document"><img alt="Components of an evaluation document" height="160" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4380/35769878313_91ed626b1a_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>Depending on your evaluation goal and style, you might need to include a rating scale that will help you determine the degree to which something is or is not occurring in your teaching episode. Not every evaluation has a rating scale, but they can support clearer understanding of the evaluation, simpler decision making, and enable easier dissemination of results, where applicable. The following rating table has been taken from the StudyDesk Expectations evaluation rubric.</p>

<h2>4. Another example evaluation</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-eecf-2a5b-4e5f-c9863e4da3a6">Time to look at another more broadly used example of evaluation, in particular, Charlotte Danielson’s (2007) <a href="http://www.salemschools.com/uploads/file/Forms/2013-framework-for-teaching-evaluation-instrument.pdf">Framework for Teaching Evaluation Instrument</a>. The intent behind examining the Danielson framework is to examine how they have constructed and described their criteria, indicators and evidence. The Danielson Framework has been included so that you can see a non-tabular version. Evaluation rubrics/frameworks/supporting documents can be designed in many different ways, and it can be dependent on the types of data and evidence that you are using.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alvarez et al. (2011) describe the original intent behind this work was “that it be used for self-assessment, teacher preparation, recruitment and hiring, mentoring, peer coaching, supervision, and evaluation” (p. 61). It’s a tool to help make judgements about complex task of teaching within schools (not higher education, but it might arguably be used in higher education). It does this by identifying “four domains of teaching responsibility: planning and preparation (Domain 1), classroom environment (Domain 2), instruction (Domain 3), and professional responsibilities (Domain 4)” (Alvarez et al., 2011, p. 61). Each domain broken up further with indicators, criteria and evidence.</p>

<h2>5. Choosing criteria, indicators and evidence</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-0dce896b-eed1-6be1-d889-fd8a0c11415b">Designing an evaluation document/rubric/instrument is complex. How do you know what is important? What is not?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alvarez et al (2011) explain that the Danielson Framework arose out of work done at a large educational testing service in the USA. It was developed “using practice, wisdom and research”, field tested and further researched. Research that is outlined in more detail in Danielson (2007).</p>
<p dir="ltr">You (and most practising higher education teachers) don’t have the time (and perhaps knowledge) to undertake such rigorous and important work in developing your evaluation instrument. What can you do?</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are at least three possible answers to that question:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Use your own knowledge and assumptions;<br class="kix-line-break">As established <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803179&amp;chapterid=66003">earlier in the course</a>, your existing assumptions are not the best foundation upon which to base practice. It is important that you question those assumptions.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Use existing theory to guide your design; or,<br class="kix-line-break">As established earlier, theory can be a <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803194&amp;chapterid=66013">useful way to question assumptions</a> and <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803194&amp;chapterid=66012">focus on what’s important</a> for learning and teaching.</p>

<h2>6. Using theory</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-eed2-4405-7e4e-0605cc2e0a4e">Back in <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803194&amp;chapterid=66012">the week 2 learning path</a> you were introduced to the perspective of theory as a tool for offering an informed perspective on a complex domain and offering principles for action. With evaluation, theory can be used in at least two broad ways:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The design of broad evaluation approaches (or paradigms).<br class="kix-line-break">The Ross (2010) reading from earlier in this book describes five classifications of evaluation approaches, which are arguably based on different broad theoretical foundations.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The design of specific evaluation plans and instruments.<br class="kix-line-break">One you’ve chosen a particular evaluation approach/paradigm the design of your particular plan or instrument can be guided by theory. For example, theory can guide your choice of criteria, indicators and evidence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Given the focus here on helping you answer the question</p>
<blockquote>How might I evaluate my teaching?</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">The focus here will be on the second way - using theory to design specific evaluation plans. The next couple of pages illustrate the theory and literature underpinning the StudyDesk expectations document and look at a paper that uses theory to identify three different ways for students to evaluate teaching.</p>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chickering and Gamson’s (1987) seven principles for good practice in undergraduate education; and,<br class="kix-line-break">A widely used and updated advice on effective features of good learning design. Principle #2 - develop reciprocity and cooperation among students - can be seen in the expectation document’s indicator 10.4 - Activities explicitly encourage collaboration and interaction between students.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://coi.athabascau.ca/coi-model/an-interactive-coi-model/">Community of Inquiry Model</a>.<br class="kix-line-break">This work proposes that there are three important components of an educational experience: <a href="https://coi.athabascau.ca/coi-model/description-cognitive-presence/">cognitive presence</a>, <a href="https://coi.athabascau.ca/coi-model/description-social-presence/">social presence</a>, and <a href="https://coi.athabascau.ca/coi-model/description-teaching-presence/">teaching presence</a>. Teaching presence - “defined as the design, facilitation, and direction of cognitive and social processes for the purpose of realising personally meaningful and educational worthwhile learning outcomes” - can be seen in a number of the elements of the expectation document’s first criteria. For example, indicator 1.8 Each weekly/topic section includes an explicit guide for required student activity”.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.2. Using theory to ponder Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET)</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-eed4-3893-10a4-ad21f73f1ce7">Most universities employ a form of student evaluation of teaching (SET) in the form of end of semester surveys for each course. Tran (2015) identifies that a major issue with much of this practice is based on implicit and explicit beliefs about quality learning. Tran (2015) argues that the use of frameworks or theories of teaching and student learning offer a useful way to “unpack the ‘hidden’ assumption about teaching in any teaching evaluation” (p. 51). (Remember <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803179&amp;chapterid=66003">that assumptions</a> are a major challenge to TISL). To demonstrate this, Tran (2015) uses Bigg’s 3P model of teaching and learning to identify three different approaches to SET and then argue for a particular approach.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As you develop the evaluation plan for your teaching episode, ask yourself about the focus of your evaluation: what students are; what the teacher does; or, what students do?</p>

<h2>7. Reuse other evaluation instruments</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-eed5-e67e-9be9-f920f247a093">There has always been work going on around the evaluation of learning and teaching, interest that has grown in recent years with a growing expectation that higher education should be able to demonstrate its effectiveness and value for money.

 <!-- ******** Sub-chapter:  7.1. Challenges to re-use **********  -->

<h3>7.1. Challenges to re-use</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-eef4-f226-6bdc-cee1c335174f">Wiliam (2006) argues</p>
<blockquote>That is why “what works” is not the right question in education. Everything works somewhere, but nothing works everywhere. (p. 17)</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Taking something (e.g. an evaluation instrument) from one educational context and using it in another is not always straight forward or appropriate. Differences in the context may make re-use less than useful.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Use of the Danielson framework</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Earlier in this book you looked at the Danielson framework and its origins. It is an approach to evaluation that has been widely used in the United States, especially more recently as part of moves in that country based around the idea of teacher accountability. A movement that received significant government funding and hence focused the attention of many stakeholders. A number of whom - including the <a href="http://k12education.gatesfoundation.org/resource/danielsons-framework-for-teaching-for-classroom-observations/">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> -  looked to the Danielson framework as a potential tool.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2016/04/20/charlotte-danielson-on-rethinking-teacher-evaluation.html">this blog post</a>, Danielson herself reflects on some of the issues with teacher accountability and its implementation the USA, including:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">“those with the responsibility to ensure good teaching in schools...don&#39;t always have the skill to differentiate great teaching from that which is merely good, or perhaps even mediocre”</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">“There is also little consensus on how the profession should define ‘good teaching.’”</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">“Even when personnel policies define good teaching as the teaching practices that promote student learning and are validated by independent research, few jurisdictions require their evaluators to actually demonstrate skill in making accurate judgments”</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">“since evaluators must assign a score, teaching is distilled to numbers, ratings, and rankings, conveying a reductive nature to educators&#39; professional worth and undermining their overall confidence in the system.”</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">“I&#39;m deeply troubled by the transformation of teaching from a complex profession requiring nuanced judgment to the performance of certain behaviors that can be ticked off on a checklist.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Comments that touch on some of the difficulties associated with evaluation and measurement, such as those raised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law">Campbell’s law</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s law</a>.</p>

<p>Issues that are somewhat reinforced by <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2016/04/20/charlotte-danielson-on-rethinking-teacher-evaluation.html#comment-3335867644">the comments</a> on Danielson’s post. Especially those that give an insight into the apparent experience of teachers who have experience use of the Danielson framework.

<h2>8. A critical view of evaluation</h2>

<p>
<script src="https://djon.es/edu8702_macro.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</p>

<p><link href="https://djon.es/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"></p>

<p> A critical inquiry into evaluation would seek to reveal some of the assumptions that underpin it in order to better understand it and its impact. Again, due to space, we’ll only briefly touch on this and we’ll start with the following scene from the movie Dead Poet’s Society.</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LjHORRHXtyI" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-94cfd848-eef6-3fde-74e9-feee63c7e717"><a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=HAYoDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22rubric+nation%22&amp;ots=znGcSHldFt&amp;sig=PtHO94AsMEfLd20t5moAEguRbB0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rubric%20nation%22&amp;f=false">The foreword</a> (Westheimer, 2015) from the book “Rubric Nation: Critical Inquiries on the Impact of Rubrics in Education” uses this scene to make one point about evaluation. In particular, the use of rubrics and the type of evaluation to which the Danielson framework has been put in the USA. It argues that those sort of calls for standardised measures and evaluation are part of a broader global movement.    It goes on to identify some of issues that may arise from evaluation.  In particular,</p>
<blockquote>..the idea that we should clearly articulate educational goals and then devise methods for determining whether those goals are met is irresistibly tidy...Uncritical acceptance of even such a commonsense-seeming idea, however, is misguided for the following reason: education is first and foremost about human relationship and interaction, and as anyone who tried to create a rubric for family fealty or for love or for trust would discover, any effort to quantify complex human interactions quickly devolves into a fool’s errand. (Westheimer, 2015, p. viii)</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">These comments are specifically aimed at the idea of standardised evaluation, not to individual teachers evaluating their own performance in contextually appropriate and informed ways. As such they appear to offer a potential explanation for some of <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2016/04/20/charlotte-danielson-on-rethinking-teacher-evaluation.html#comment-3335867644">the comments</a> on Danielson’s blog post. They also point to some of the challenges in widespread re-use of evaluation instruments or approaches from other contexts, and the inherent difficulty involved in evaluating learning and teaching.</p></div>

<h2>9. Strategies for designing evaluation</h2>

<p>The following pages provide an overview of four strategies that can help you design your evaluation clearly and solidly. The four strategies are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<script src="https://djon.es/edu8702_macro.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
Embed your evaluation in the learning and teaching process for learners and teachers.</li>
<li>Plan the evaluation with deliberate intent</li>
<li>Think carefully about your data collection and sampling procedures.</li>
<li>Close the loop: feedback and feedforward what you learn from your evaluation.</li>
</ol>

<div class="book_chapter"><a name="ch66657"></a>
<h3>9.1. Embed your evaluation in the L&amp;T process</h3>

<p>When designing your learning and teaching activities, think about ways to make your students’ progress in learning explicitly visible to them and to yourself.</p>

<p>For example, in EDU8702, you can see your activity tracking on the right side of the course activity page - you can track your progress through the content in this way. You are also asked to regularly reflect on your learning through your blog and your assignments are designed to review those reflections and build on them.</p>

<p>These combined learning experiences can be a valuable source of evaluative information for you as the learner and the teacher. Both can see your progress and development in terms of the course content, learning design, and progress.

<h3>9.2. Plan the evaluation with intent</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-e49d-876f-8c99-a96430f09f8b">This refers to the evaluation component prompts that you discovered in Week 5 and that were reiterated in the Examine book. However, there are two additional prompts regarding timelines and resources, because these need to be known in order to design an evaluation.</p>
<ol><ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What is the <strong>purpose</strong> of the evaluation?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What kinds of <strong>evidence</strong> will help you understand more about these issues or aims?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What <strong>sources</strong> of information will you use?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What <strong>methods</strong> or approach will you take in collecting the information?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What <strong>timeline</strong> would be best for undertaking each element of the evaluation?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">What <strong>resources</strong> and support do you have?</p>
</li>
</ol></ol>
<p dir="ltr">It is important to ensure that each of these aspects of the evaluation align. In this way, they will form a strong basis for the evaluation. The following evaluation planning grid is an example of how you can investigate the alignment of these components.</p>

<h3>9.3. Think about data collection and sampling procedures</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-e4a0-e167-1a47-95d9ad9ac166">Remember to check the university requirements regarding evaluation of learning and teaching, and adhere to any policies that might be in place, e.g. the <a href="http://policy.usq.edu.au/documents/13320PL">Evaluation of Teaching, Courses and Programs Policy and Procedure </a>at USQ. Also, discuss evaluation with your colleagues to learn from their experiences.</p>
<ol><ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Use multiple viewing lenses or triangulation. If you collect data from multiple sources and/or a variety of perspectives, it creates richer and deeper understanding of what is happening in the area being evaluated. For example, collecting student and teacher feedback can provide a more in-depth understanding of a teaching episode.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Decide on the amount, type, and format of data based on what you need and what you can use. Ensure that the amount, type, and format of data aligns with your evaluation purpose.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Consider your sampling procedures and response rates, where applicable.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Complete any evaluation questionnaires or tasks yourself. This will help you check for errors, comprehensibility, and reasonability.</p>

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-e4a1-79de-37aa-9fb661354b41">After you have completed the evaluation and determined actions based on the results, consider who else might benefit from hearing about your evaluation, and how you might disseminate this information to them. As you would have seen throughout these two weeks on evaluation, it is difficult to find information on evaluation of teaching practice in higher education, so your colleagues could benefit significantly from you sharing your experiences, learnings, and outcomes.</p>

<h2>5. Developing your evaluation plan</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-97bbb854-e4b4-62d1-04d8-8565ee5e8ac8">Combine the information from Parts 1 to 3 into an evaluation plan. You will need to consider how to present the various pieces of information so that a colleague could also use the evaluation plan for the teaching episode. This will help you consider the clarity of the information that you are presenting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You can create an artefact that reflects the way you understand your evaluation and the content - there is no predetermined format to use. Recollect the evaluation frameworks that you have seen in Week 5 and Week 6, and if any of these aligned with the way you think.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once you have created your artefact, share it on your blog with a reflection on the process of creating your evaluation plan. Your reflection should highlight your key learnings, any difficulties you faced, and any other considerations that you want to make regarding your evaluation plan.</p>
