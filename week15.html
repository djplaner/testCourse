<h2>1. Why?</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-f5ce3914-4283-6eaf-96e2-c4b3468a3a8d">The focus of this learning path is explicitly on trying to answer the driving question for this entire course (and for this week)</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 30px;">How will you become a master teacher in higher education?</p>
<p dir="ltr">This learning is also intended to help you develop an answer to the related, but more specific question</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 30px;">How will I become a master teacher?</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is the question you must respond to through your response <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65156#c">to Assignment 2, Part C</a>. The description for this assessment task is</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 30px;">Considering all that has been presented in this course and all of your reflections in your blog posts, write a reflective blog post that develops your plan for continued development as a master teacher. You should include milestones with achievable outcomes that will demonstrate your continued development as a master teacher in your discipline. This blog post should demonstrate your full understanding of the content of this course and how it can be implemented in your context.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Completing <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65156#c">Assignment 2, Part C</a> is a purely pragmatic purpose associated with completing this course. Beyond that, it is hoped that the plan you develop for Assignment 2, Part C is something that you can actually use to achieve the goal of becoming a master teacher in higher education. Or, at the very least move your further toward that goal than you are now, by drawing on the insights and knowledge you have developed over the last semester.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This week has also been designed as a “capstone week” based around a capstone assessment task. i.e. an attempt to consolidate all that has gone before.</p>

<h2>2. What?</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-df6c902b-4284-c224-b021-728402859b4a">To refine and develop your plan to become a master teacher this learning path will ask you to:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Gather all existing planning that you’ve done.<br class="kix-line-break">This is what you’ll be asked to do next.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Evaluate and critique those plans using two different methods.<br class="kix-line-break">The <em>Examining</em> section of this learning path will combine two different methods to guide you through an evaluation of your existing plans and help you develop ideas for how to improve and expand existing plans.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Work through one summary of the course content.<br class="kix-line-break">The <em>Explaining</em> section of this learning path will offer you my summary of the course content. It will provide a brief walk through of the course, pointing out (one person’s opinion of) the interesting/important points and suggestions for how they might be used to inform a plan to become a master teacher in higher education. The intent is that this may remind you of something you’ve forgotten, or provide a different take on a concept from the course that may help inform your plan (and perhaps other parts of the assignment).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Combine all of the above to refine and develop your response to <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65156#c">Assignment 2, Part C</a>.<br class="kix-line-break">Lastly, the <em>Apply</em> section will ask you to apply all of the knowledge above to working on Assignment 2, Part C.</p>

<h2>2. Components and criteria of A2, Part C</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-a431e7ff-428c-94cf-d6c9-ccf57147063a">Your response to <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=790234&amp;chapterid=65156#c">Assignment 2, Part C</a> should</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 30px;">should present a critical reflection that develops a plan for your continued development as a master teacher (emphasis added)</p>
<p dir="ltr">The emphasis in the above corresponds to the two main criteria in the associated rubric.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">What is a plan?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Your response should include a plan that you can use over the coming years. It should connect with where you are now and help you improve your teaching in ways important to you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Oxford Dictionaries provide the following definition of <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/plan">plan</a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 30px;">A detailed proposal for doing or achieving something.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other definitions are provided, but this is the one relevant here. A plan does not (and in this case, probably should not) be presented as paragraphs of text. Feel free to use tables, timelines, images or other representations of your plan, especially if it is a representation that you can actively use after the course finishes.</p>

<h3>2.1. General advice for A2, Part C</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-4c599cdd-428d-9ca9-be4d-6bb66c885a65">Given the centrality of the plan, the hope that it is something  you can use after the course, and the suggested word count of 700 words your submission for Assignment 2, Part C does not need to have all the formal trappings of a formal academic essay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some general advice:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Don’t waste word count on an introduction or conclusion.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Do use APA for formal academic references, but use web links for websites etc.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Feel free to use paragraphs for your critical reflection, but also feel free to present your reflection in different ways. <br class="kix-line-break">(e.g.the tables used to show the <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803194&amp;chapterid=66015">categories of teaching experience and practice</a>, or <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803194&amp;chapterid=66016">pedagogical models</a> from earlier in the course)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Do not offer detailed explanations of learning and teaching concepts or terms.<br class="kix-line-break">(e.g. don’t waste word count explaining what blended learning is)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The focus your reflection and your plan should be showing that you are able to synthesise the content from the rest of this course with your other knowledge and apply it to providing a critical reflection on what is required to become a master teacher in your context, and a plan that will help  you achieve it.</p>

The following section draws on the work to help prompt additional thinking by you for your own professional learning, especially as you look to answer the question “How will I become a master teacher?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">They start by focusing on the question</p>
<p dir="ltr">How do professionals learn and develop?</p>
<p dir="ltr">And identify five sub-questions used to identify their answer.</p>

<h3>3.1. What?</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-807b00db-4291-2d43-a8e7-dd381abee261">Knight, Tait, &amp; Yorke (2006) argue that</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 30px;">Until now we have treated professional learning in a relatively undifferentiated way. However, it is well known that different student learning outcomes call for different teaching approaches, and it is assumed that the same is true for teachers and others who support student learning in higher education (pp. 334-335)</p>
<p dir="ltr">The rubric for Assignment 2, Part C includes the following</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 30px;">The plan identifies a clear process that will achieve the identified goal for continued development</p>
<p dir="ltr">Knight et al (2006) identify that increasingly governments, management and professional developers appears to have a desire to define what should be learned by educational professionals. Examples of this include <a href="http://uniteachingcriteria.edu.au/">the Australian University Teacher Standards and Criteria and </a>the <a href="https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/system/files/downloads/uk_professional_standards_framework.pdf">UK Professional Standards Framework</a>. But Knight et al (2006) explain that often these people don&#39;t speak with a single voice.</p>

<p>Knight et al (2006) stress the importance of the <em>what</em> taking account of the diversity of practice in higher education, especially the most distinctive difference which exists between practice in different subject areas.</p>

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-57ccee44-42a1-cc50-9d63-7e7009789402">Knight et al (2006) suggest that the view of professional learning as non-formal, non-intentional learning positions it as something that happens all the time. However, they also suggest that there a four reasons why this view is insufficient, including:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A focus on learning happening all the time runs the “risk of staleness, professional obsolescence and institutional sclerosis” (p. 333).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Such learning can be locked into the specific setting and invisible outside it, there is benefit in undertaking the intentional activity of translating this implicit knowledge in ways that can be shared.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The needs and priorities of people change over time as they enter different stages of their career.</p>

<h3>3.5. Where?</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-f5ce3914-42a2-e200-db82-6be064807a1e">Knight et al (2006) describe their view of educational professional development “as a creation of people’s daily activity systems” (p. 334). They conceive of professional learning as being “an interplay between individuals and their environments” (Knight et al, 2006, p. 320).</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Activity system limiting professional learning</h4>
<p dir="ltr">They explain how there can be issues in the activity system (environment/context) that limit the impact of professional learning. They explain that</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 30px;">These mismatches can be associated with underperformance, although they can also motivate system learning and change (Engeström, 2001). Our interpretation of this is that successful EPD involves attending to the person (the subject) and to the system’s tools, rules, beliefs (located in the community of practice) and division of power (or division of labour): it is concerned with personal understandings and capabilities and with addressing systems’ understandings and capabilities (Knight et al, 2006, p. 321)</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Activity system as a source of professional learning</h4>
<p dir="ltr">They also identify how professional learning arises from four different locations (Knight et al, 2006, p. 334):</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The daily activity system in which educators work.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Distributed activity systems such as National Teaching Awards (e.g. <a href="https://www.education.gov.au/how-nominate-australian-awards-university-teaching">AAUT</a>) or disciplinary bodies focused on learning and teaching (e.g. <a href="http://sigcse.org/sigcse/">ACM SIGCSE</a>)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Formal PD events organised by specialist teams.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The various communities and resources online.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p></p>


<div class="dj_task" id="connect">


<div class="dj_task_title">

<p>What are the activity system(s) in which your will learn?</p>
</div>


<div class="dj_activity">
<p dir="ltr">Pay special attention (attend) to the environment(s) in which your professional learning will take place in terms of the personal, institutional and disciplinary. Rather than simply engaging in generic professional learning, you will need to consider how your plan can respond, overcome and benefit from your context.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Does your plan include crafting your teaching activity system (as much as you can) to create something that helps learning and growth.  A part of this is ensuring that you connect your activity system with various other sources of professional learning.  Does your plan explain (perhaps by providing links) to the nature of your activity system?</p>

<h2>1. What and why?</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-0943d54b-42a5-1e73-5e41-781e8c28fa5f">The rubric for Assignment 2, Part C includes the following</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 30px;">provides succinct description of processes based on literature and/or experience, and includes evidence of critical reflection on relevant course content, e.g. evaluation, identification of emerging practices, etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">i.e. your plan should be supported by your critical reflections on the content of this course and subsequent literature that you’ve engaged with.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This section offers my summary of the content of this course week by week. It includes my explanation of how the weekly course content might be connected to all parts of Assignment 2, but especially Part C - your plan for becoming a master teacher.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is a personal summary intended to help remind you of content from  the course and spark your own reflections (i.e. feel free to disagree with my description or the content covered and provide arguments supporting that disagreement) on the course content and how it might help you, especially in answering the question “How will I become a master teacher?”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Where you might want to pay special attention</h4>

<p>The following summary of the semester suggests that the following learning paths might be particularly useful for Assignment 2, Part C, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Week 1 where it touches on what a master teacher is, one of the goals of your plan is to develop you into a master teacher. What is a master teacher?</li>
<li>Week 2 introduces one perspective on critical reflection, demonstrating critical reflection on the course content and other literature is essential to achieving top marks in Assignment 2.</li>
<li>Week 3 offers advice on how to find and evaluate emerging practice, doing this effectively could well be an important part of your plan to become a master teacher.</li>
<li>Week 4 examines analytics, which is integral to the integrated model of TISL and potentially useful for your plan to become a master teacher.</li>
<li>Week 5 makes mention of peer and self evaluation (amongst other types of evaluation). These two types of evaluation may be a useful component of a plan to become a master teacher.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>The following also mentions other weeks that could help directly with other parts of Assignment 2.</p>

<h2>2. Week 1 - Where do master teachers come from?</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-f5ce3914-42a5-b869-d8d4-640700cbbf04">The focus of the <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/course/view.php?id=9664&amp;section=2#startweek">first learning path</a> was on the idea of master teachers and in particular “Where do master teachers come from?”. What are the behaviours, qualities, or <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=798710">attributes of a master teacher</a>? It argued that master teachers arises from engaging in a<a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=798713&amp;chapterid=65798"> reflective, self critical and theoretically informed approach</a> to recognise their faults and struggling to improve. Week 1 introduced the idea of Teacher Inquiry into Student Learning (TISL) as the particular approach to becoming a master teacher t<a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=798714">hat would be used in this course</a>. As a first step toward this, this week shared some introductory thoughts <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=798711">on reflection and writing to think</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Assignment 2, Part C asks you to develop a plan to become a master teacher that is contextually and developmentally appropriate to you. The ideas introduced this week would appear to be a good starting point, both in terms of what that might look like and how you might achieve it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The following table summarises the results of <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/feedback/view.php?id=798661">the survey</a> you were asked to complete in Week 1. The survey asked you to rank various attributes/practices of a teacher in order of importance (1 to 10). There were four responses (hence not a large sample size). The following table ranks those attributes in descending order based on the average response rate and the standard deviation between the response.</p>

<h2>3. Week 2 - How happy am I with my assumptions around learning and teaching?</h2>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-3483c53f-42a8-595f-8f05-761e8a7bdc7a">The <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/course/view.php?id=9664&amp;section=3#startweek">Week 2 learning path</a> was based on the assumption that our development as master teachers (not to mention just about anything in our lives) is <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803179&amp;chapterid=66003">limited by our assumptions</a>. In particular, it identified issues with engaging in TISL if assumptions were not unearthed and questioned. It started with <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803052&amp;chapterid=65976">examining the first phase of TISL</a> - initiation - and the different types of issues that can spark TISL. It asked you to <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803052&amp;chapterid=65997">identify the context</a> in which you would focus you attentions this semester.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Week 2 offered the idea of reflection as a means to overcome the constraints of our assumptions. It offered a developmental framework of reflection that <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803179&amp;chapterid=66000">defined four types of writing</a> (3 of which are reflective); <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803179&amp;chapterid=66001">typical elements of reflection</a>; <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803179&amp;chapterid=66008">three types of assumptions</a>; and, a <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803179&amp;chapterid=66004">process for critical reflection</a>. Week 2 also discussed the role <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803194&amp;chapterid=66012">theory</a> can play in helping to  inform the process of critical reflection and surfacing assumptions and offered three examples of how theory could help, including: <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803194&amp;chapterid=66014">3 levels of teaching</a>; <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803194&amp;chapterid=66015">categories of teaching experience and practice</a>; and, <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803194&amp;chapterid=66016">pedagogical models</a>. <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=803226&amp;chapterid=66019">You were asked</a> to use this insight to start examining your discipline and context and start identifying what is known and accepted in terms of learning and teaching. In particular, to start identifying and surfacing the assumptions that underpin teaching in your context.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Critical reflection is a key part of Assignment 2. Your plan to become a master teacher (Assignment 2, Part C) should draw heavily on the work you did and the practices identified during this week.</p>

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-88841029-42a8-d02c-e2a1-1f61d44e7ad0"><a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/course/view.php?id=9664&amp;section=4#startweek">The week 3 learning path</a> is based on the idea that a master teacher looks to change not (just) because of external factors, but as part of what Common (1989) called the struggle to improve (perhaps in response to external changes, but also because of student learning). Master teachers look to improve, they look for emerging practices that will help them improve. The question is how do you do this.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The learning path started by <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=806042&amp;chapterid=66127">defining emerging practice</a> as something new to your teaching practice. It then <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=806043">introduced two different takes</a> on what emerging practice in higher education might look like in the coming years. The learning path introduced <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=806150&amp;chapterid=66133">CLEM</a> as one way for finding emerging practice. In terms of evaluating newly discovered emerging practices, the learning path offered <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=806150&amp;chapterid=66139">PKM</a> and a <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=806150&amp;chapterid=66139">critical eye</a>. It offered examples of CLEM (<a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=806150&amp;chapterid=66134">learning design</a>) and critical evaluations of <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=806150&amp;chapterid=66141">educational technology</a> and the <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=806150&amp;chapterid=66142">Horizon Reports</a>. It also offered a deeper look at <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=806158">teaching as design</a> as a form of emerging practice that is both increasingly important and importantly linked to TISL.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It finished by asking you to <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=806161&amp;chapterid=66148">start developing plans</a> for how you could identify emerging practice in your discipline. This was intended to start your development of Assignment 1, Part C.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This work should also be directly informing your work on Assignment 2 for both parts B and C.</p>

It started by <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=809181">providing examples of evaluation</a> from both outside and within higher education and asking you to <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=809184">reflect on your experiences</a> of evaluation. The main focus of the learning was to <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=809187">explain what evaluation was and touch on various topics</a>, including: the goals of evaluation; types of evaluation; the notion of evidence; the types of methods and processes that might be used; and, to touch on criticisms of evaluation. At the end of the learning path you <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=809192">were asked to identify the teaching episode</a> you would evaluate for Assignment 2, Part B.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Evaluation - covered both in the week 5 and 6 learning paths - will be of direct interest to Assignment 2, Part B, which requires that you describe your plan to evaluate your TISL process (L&amp;T grant).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=809187&amp;chapterid=66361">types of evaluation section</a> also mentions type of evaluation that may be useful for your plan to become a master teacher. In particular, the concept of self-evaluation and peer-evaluation may be useful processes to include in your plan to become a master teacher.

It started by <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=815098&amp;chapterid=66649">defining a teaching episode</a> and providing an example of <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=815098&amp;chapterid=66648">an evaluation instrument</a> and asking you to use it to <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=815098&amp;chapterid=66650">evaluate this course</a>. Drawing on concepts from the week 5 learning path you were then asked to<a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=815115"> examine the evaluation instrument</a>. The main <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=815133">new content</a> in this learning path introduced you to topics such as: different approaches to evaluation; the components of an evaluation document (criteria, indicators and evidence); how to select/design these components by using theory and reusing other evaluation instruments; a critical view of evaluation; and, finally, four strategies for designing evaluation. The learning path closed with a set of exercises intended to step you through one process for designing an evaluation.</p>

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-019373c2-42aa-b959-2695-63e054eac24e"><a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/course/view.php?id=9664&amp;section=8#startweek">The week 7 learning path</a>  marked the start of working directly on Assignment 2. In particular, it asked you to start thinking about the research question that you would like to answer through TISL. A research question that would/should drive the design of your L&amp;T grant application for Assignment 2, Part B. The learning path started by presenting a series of <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=816672&amp;chapterid=66815">starting points</a> intended to help you identify a question/spark of importance to your teaching. It then offered some <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=816672&amp;chapterid=66816">examples of research questions</a> used in classroom research. You were asked to then evaluate these example research questions using some <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=816696">initial criteria for a good Action Research Question</a>. The learning path then <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=816697">stepped through one process for developing a good research question</a> and covered topics including: where to research questions come from; what are the characteristics of a good question; explicit advice to focus on the students and not the teacher; and, how to frame your research question. Lastly, the learning path <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=816707">provided a sequence</a> of exercises to help you develop your research question.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This week is most directly connected to Assignment 2, Part B. In particular, it is suggested that the criteria and characteristics of good research questions could be usefully used to evaluate the spark behind your L&amp;T grant application. It is also a good idea to ensure that your grant idea is <a href="https://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au/m2/mod/book/view.php?id=816697&amp;chapterid=66825">focused on the students</a> and what they do, rather than you and what you do.</p>
